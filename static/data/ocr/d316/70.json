However, X have just written to him\nand asked for some of the objectives which Marshall says he can\nprovide. It seems to me completely impossible to tell whether a\nweek or two is a long enough period in which to get results which\nwill hold up until we have a pretty good idea of what these objectives\nare —that is to say, until we know what kinds of behavior changes\nMarshall will be trying to make in the students.\nX wonder too about this sudden new idea to try out the course on\nG^^al i;iectric executives.

If he tries to do two at once, or\ntries to make one which will do both jobs, X do not have such faith\nin what the result will be.\nXn addition to asking about objectives, X also took the liberty of\nasking Foshay how much time he would be trilling to spend on this\nproject. X would say that he should be used as much as he is willing\nto be used. Xn regard to the time of committee members, this depends\nupon whether you accept the recommendation that a full time research\nperson be employed. Xf not, then you need a tremendous amount of\nconsulting time. Xf you do, it could be fairly minimal. Pretty much\nthe same sort of thing holds for the rest of the budget. It will\nmake a tremendous difference if we are talking about an experiment in"
