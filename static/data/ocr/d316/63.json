That each space is a unique space-\ntime event, and that each time is likewise\nunique? Does this mean that we, in the electron¬\nic age, have begun to share the outlook of the\ncave-man? |\ny\nHave we, during the recent centuries of print,\nof uniformity and repeatability, developed a\nway of life that is incompatible with our\nelectrical technology?\nCan understanding the effect of our technologies\nupon our habits and outlook help to avoid con¬\nfusion and undue stress during period of\naccelerated change?"
