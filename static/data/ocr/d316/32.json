The objectives agreed upon are as follows:\n(a) Identification of major media developments in\nour environment, and their relation to new\nscience and technology.\n(b) Familiarity with the various and often\ncontradictory qualities and effects of\nmedia.\n(c) Greater awareness of ways in which words,\n• concepts, and data may be used, or misused,\nin the handling of media matters.\nIt seemed to the committee more practical to do a live test\nof Syllabus, rather than to repeat specific tests on the\nefficacy of various toedia in the class-room. Since the Syllabus .\nis built on new assumptions about media a3 possessing mutational\npowers quite independent of their program content, it was de¬\ncided to find out whether such a Syllabus would effect significant\nchanges of perception and Judgment in class-room conditions.\nSeptember 28th\nConsulting with the Educational Division of General Electric at\nCrotonville on their experience in the use of Syllabus and Kits\nin training personnel. The Crotonville Management Center is\nconsidering the possibility of giving the media Syllabus a\nseveral week try-out in one of their groups of 45 executives at\nCrotonville, They have a full team of psychologists and testers\nwho would be pleased to pay strict attention to the experiment.\ncontinued."
