  "text": "Department of Speech\nAnd Dramatic Art\nState University or Iowa\nIowa City\nCOPY\nSeptember 18, 1959\nDr. Marshall McLuhan\n29 Wells Hill\nToronto, Ontario\nCanada\nDear Mac:\nHarry's recent letter has stimulated the following thoughts -\nfor whatever they may be worth.\nIt seems to me that this research must proceed in two steps,\nindicated by two different kinds of questions*\n1* One must first ask the kind of general question which\nHarry S. has suggested * i.e*. How is an individual af¬\nfected by the same content received via different media?\nThe kinds of answers one gets to this question are depen¬\ndent on where and how he observes* There are obviously\nan infinite number of kinds of effects. In general, one\nis so important in research that one have a McLuhan around\nwho has a great deal of insight* One cannot stop with\nthese observations however* They could be a chance occur¬\nence* They may be caused by something other than what the\nobserver thinks causes them* They may be “real\" only with¬\nin the observer* This step of the research must lead to\nthe next step in which one tests the hypotheses growing\nout of the above.\n2* £*g*, if the same crime story is communicated through both\nradio and television to fifth grade youngsters, those who\nhear the story only will be affected to a greater extent\nin this specific way*\nIn other words, 1 think 1 am saying that in the first phase of\nthe study one must ask what are all of the unique \"messages'* of each\nmedium. In the second phase, one must compare media to see if, in a con¬\ntrolled situation, one can actually attribute specific messages to\nspecific media*"
