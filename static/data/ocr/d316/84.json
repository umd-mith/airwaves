We'll try to get 'em around,\nwhere they'll do some good.\nGlad the street address problem is all set. Sorry for printer's\ndelay on the stationery. Will add P. S. on this. Tried to check\nby phone, but no one answered.\nThere may be some useful contacts at the Detroit Convention. Looks\nlike & big registration. With the schedule I have of appointments,\ncommittee meetings, and details, also looks like another rat-race\nfor me.\nBest,\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nHJSrjp\nP. S. Stationery and envelopes will be delivered to us on Tuesday j\nOctober 20. We'll get it right off to you."
