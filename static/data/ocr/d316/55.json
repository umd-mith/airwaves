  "text": "21.\nSESSION XX\nMANUSCRIPT CULTURE\nSession I was concerned with the cycle from pre-literate\nto post-literate living. This was the shift from audible*\nverbal* tribal* organization through the literate stages of\ndetribalization and new social structure to \"post-literacy\",\nor electronics.\nThe whole Session may be dispensable, as also this one\non the manuscript. I say this because, should these two\nSessions be thought necessary, they would naturally have to\nbe expanded a great deal. They would also be supplied with\nactual selections from various works, and not just reference\nreading.\nManuscript culture was handicraft culture. Print was\nthe first true mechanization of an ancient handicraft. And\nprinting may have owed less to the handicrafts than to the\nscholastic philosophers, with their insistence upon the uni¬\nversality and, in a sense, the uniformity of all truth and\nknowledge. For print gave material expression to this\nuniversalism, uniting, as it has often been claimed, science\nand democracy.\nThe fortunes of manuscript culture in the Nest fluctuated\nwith the supply of writing materials.
