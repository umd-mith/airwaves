Skornia\n1015 West Church Street\nChampaign, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nDuring my recent visit to New York In connection with LRI\nBoard meeting, I arranged to have a chat with Arno Huth.\nHe had recently returned from a tour of Africa as a consult¬\nant to the State Department and Winfield thought it would\nbe useful to talk with him. It was.\nHe was able to fill in some of the gaps in my knowledge of\nthe social and political complexity of the Sudan and had\nvaluable suggestions on procedures and approaches. His\nlist of things not to do was, perhaps, even more invaluable.\nHe said that he had had a letter from you last summer making\nreference to a possible role he might play in NAEB affairs\nand wondered if I knew to what you alluded. I suggested that\nyou might have been thinking of the Sudan contract, but he\ndid not think this wa3 the case. I said that I would write\nand ask you — which I have now done.\nThe Sudan Radio Contract is all but signed and sealed (I\nexpect a call this week for the final session) and, I under¬\nstand, the pressures are really building up from the Sudanese,\nfor action. I am especially encouraged by the likelihood\nthat we will be able to get Sid Head to be the program man.\nHe is actively interested and is now negotiating with his\nadministration to see if he can be freed.\nI had lunch two weeks ago with Paul Shinkman and Jewell\nand I were invited to their Georgetown home for dinner\nlast Saturday evening. He is very much interested in our\nnews project and vastly intrigued by the Lasswell \"clarifier\""
