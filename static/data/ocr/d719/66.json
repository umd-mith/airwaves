Am 1 to understand from paragraph one of\nthe above mentioned letter that there has been any change in our\nthinking and discussion at the recent Board meeting?\nThis is merely an inquiry because, as 1 recall, our plans were to\nset up an office in Washington, hoping that the organizations\nnow supporting JCET might coordinate and channel their activities\nthrough our office. I did not understand that we were continuing\nthe JCET, as such, but would merely offer an outlet to them\nthrough our NAEB Washington office.\nDo I understand from the above mentioned letter that Bob Shenkkan\nis being approached on the matter of staffing the Washington\noffice?\nMaybe my Interest is Jumping to conclusions. Could you fill me\nin on developments thus far.\nWith kindest regards, I am\nSincerely yours.\nRDH/ml\nRaymond D. Hurlbert\nGeneral Manager\ncc: Mr. Bill Harley"
