I found\nthat the committee was considering an invitational\nseminar to be financed either from DAVI funds or joint¬\nly with some money to be available under title VII.\nTheir deadline for this seminar is late summer or\nearly fall I960. The purpose of the seminar will be\nto develop and write a booklet on the use of television\nin classrooms•\nThe DAVI Television Committee's reaction to our utili¬\nzation kit project was very good. They could see how\nthe kits were needed and they had no plans to develop\na similar type of material. To plan a seminar there\nwill be a steering committee meeting held May 2 and 3\nimmediately preceding the IERT in Columbus. At this\ntime, plans for the invitational seminar will be firmed\nup. I should mention that this invitational seminar\nwill be largely aimed towards using experienced class¬\nroom teachers and the NEA Department of Classroom\nTeachers is working with DAVI in the planning of this\nseminar. Miss Anita Ruffing, Vice President of the\nClassroom Teachers Department, met with us in Cincinnati\nand will be meeting with us in Columbus •\nJohn W. Seeger\nNeil Sherburne\nLoring M.
