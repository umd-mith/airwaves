I cannot see how I can contact anyone about this re¬\nquest. We can only hope for the best.

I will keep\nyou informed on of my plans.\nIncidently, during the Cincinnati convention of the DAVI,\nDr. Philip Lewis and I had the opportunity to talk about these\nUtilization materials. He is a member of the DAVI Television\nCommittee and a member of the Television Sub-committee of the\nAmerican Association of Colleges of Teacher*s Education. Both\ngroups are interested in the Utilization problem and from the\nenclosed memo you can see what they have in mind. I asked Dr.\nLewis if he had seen my request letter. He indicated he had\nnot. I asked him if it would be possible for him to jar some¬\nthing loose and his answer was MI could have if you had sent"
