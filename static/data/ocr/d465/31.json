  "text": "Mr. Harold E« Hill\n2\nJanuary 15, I960\nAs far as the itinerary and budget goes I ecu Id like to use all of the\nmoney for travel and communication. Perhaps we could set a little\naside for me to use on long distance charges particularly in this\ninitial setting up phase. I would prefer to keep the decisions cm\nthe Itinerary until later. The first thing to be done is to send\nout letters to the various people in the field who might be in a\nposition to supply some material. The itinerary of visits would then\nbe more meaningful since we would know where we might unearth some\nuseful material. Basically, I think a visit to headquarters is in\nline and then a swing throu^i the east picking up two or three loca¬\ntions. Any other visits will depend on the money available. I*m\nnot trying to hedge on setting up this itinerary. This would be a\nvery easy thing to do but, in the interest of getting as much out\nof the money as possible, I would like very much to wait until I\nhave had some answers to my letters •\nIf this meets with your approval I will get the letters on the way\nat once# If a sum can be set aside to cover long distance calls I\ncould follow up some of these letters with calls to specific loca¬\ntions. I think a sum of #50.00 would be sufficient to cover these\nfirst calls.\nI hope this helps bring the picture into some kind of focus. One\nother thing I would suggestjthat during my visit to the east, I stop\nin to talk with the people at the U.S. Office of Education in\nWashington. Again this might be something that could be better\nhandled by you or Harry.\nCordially,\nChairman, Television\nUtilization Sub-committee\nCRT/gvn\nc.c. Harry Skomia"
