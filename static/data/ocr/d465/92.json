Tetteraer\nDirector of School Programs\nStation KTCA-TV\nTwin City Area Educational\nTelevision Corporation\nSt* Paul 8, Minnesota\nDear Clairs\nSince you won*t be able to wind up the project In time for an\naccounting around the first of July, I believe your suggestion\nfor billing us in advance of that date may be the best bet.\nIf you can get in the other expenses you mentioned (in fact,\nanything at all that is outstanding), then I can let you knew\nhow much you should bill us for \"Consultation Services,\" by\nJuly 1. \"If you can*t get m an exact accounting, perhaps you\ncan at least get me a fairly accurate estimate.\nAlso, will you please count oh preparing for m 1 fairly brief\naccount of the project (with exhibits if possible), so that I\ncan incorporate it into a report which l will have to prepare\nfor the Foundation? This also would be heeded by very shortly\nafter the first of July, so that I can send I final report, plus\nfinal financial statement, to them within the first couple of\nweeks in July. If you haven* t couple ted everything, your report\ncould indicate those things still to be done and the expected\nresults. I will also need a good description of the kit for\nwhich we paid Marguerite, with a statement as to its use - and\nalso usefulness if such can be determined by that time.\nI hate to bother you with all these details, but as you probably\nwell knew, this is the way we all must live when using foundation\nfunds. I know, too, that time Is short and that you are hard-\npressed, but we *11 wallow through this some way by the second\nweek in July, I*m sure.\nCordially,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nHSH:mr"
