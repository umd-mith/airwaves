Rosenfeld:\nI am enclosing a copy of the November, 1955 issue of the Journal\nof the Association for Education by Radio-Television. The pub¬\nlication ... almost always thirty-two pages in length ... ia\ndistributed to the membership of the Association once each month\nwith the exception of June, July, August and September. At the\npresent time, we are running about six-hundred copies per issue,\nalthough we sincerely believe that the number will increase sub¬\nstantially within the next fifteen months.\nWe are generally open to suggestion about the Journal. Please feel\nfree to make any appropriate suggestions on matters of page sise,\nlayout, type of paper and style of type. We have no preference as\nfar as the eternal debate between letterpress and offset is concerned.\nWe are principally interested in getting the best-looking Journal\npossible.\nNext week, Boston University has its Spring vacation. For that reason,\nI don’t quite know exactly when I’ll be in the office. However,\nif you will call me on CO 6-6070 (ask the operator f or the Communica¬\ntion Arts Division Office) and leave a message for me. I’ll be sure\nto get back to you.\nThanks very much.\nSincerely,\nJohn Adams Rourke\nNational Membership Chairman\nAERT"
