Pro bat. Miles, and I spent long hours at State\nCollege working up the proposal which has been forwarded to\nScottie Fletcher. We had the benefit of counsel from Dick\nHall and McCarty, as well as Parker Wheatley and Hudson. I\nam hopeful that a copy of the proposal will be forthcoming\nfrom Protest's office, because I have been very insistent that\nyou and Graydon, as alternates on the Committee, be kept fully\ninformed of everything in the way of deliberations and action.\nMy felicitations on the Lenten Music Festival. You\nhave succeeded in cracking the music pages which is what I have\nbeen talking about for several years. If some of the other\nBrethren would only take a lift from your book, we would really\nbe going places. More power to your right ana.\nI am sending you a digest of Convention Locations\nwhidh should certainly by amusing if not constructive.\nCordially yours.\nSeymour N. Siegel\nDirector\nsns/h\nEnc."
