Morton\ndated February 13 naming Burton Paulu and me to a committee to work\nwith the NUEA in the evaluation of Extension activities in the various\ncolleges and universities in the country. This appointment was in\nreply to a letter from Dr. Morton which I presented to the NAEB\nBoard meeting on January 18.\nI am enclosing a second copy of Dr. Morton's letter wherein he\noutlines his work as Chairman of the NUEA Committee on Implications\nof Atomic Energy and requests the cooperation of NAEB in exploring'\niu possibilities for expanding the work of this committee through\nuse of radio. At a later date, I wrote you that Dr. Morton had been\nappointed to conduct an NUEA-FAE study of the total Extension Division\nactivities of American colleges and universities. You apparently\nconfused his original letter with my later one and appointed Burton\nand me to the latter project rather than the former. Dr. Morton\nthis morning expressed to me the opinion that in actuality this is\na desirable step and he would be pleased to have you name a committee\nto work with him on the NUEA Extension evaluation project as well as\na committee to work on the AEC project and feels that this might\nvery well be the same committee for both projects.\nPermit me to suggest, as I have to Dr. Morton, that, because of\nthe nature of the NUEA Extension Division evaluation project, a\nresearch man such as Dallas Smythe should be added to this committee.\nIf this meets with your approval, I believe it would be in order for\nyou to write Dr. Morton naming Burton, Dallas, and me to the NAEB\nCommittee to work with the National University Extension Association's\nCommittee on Implications of Atomic Energy and, to work with him on the\nNUEA evaluation project.\nIt was good seeing you in Illinois last week and I shall look\nforward to seeing you at our Oklahoma meeting.\ncCEujJIu)\nJLAS-4. —\nGA/ns\nccs Burton Paulu\nSincerely yours.\nGraydon Ausrnus, Vice-President\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
