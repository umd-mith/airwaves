A formal report will be\nforthcoming which, I am certain, will present highly con¬\nstructive facts.

I must confess that\nI am completely behind on what has gone on. What ’'committee\"\nare you referring to when you say \"The question this committee\nshould consider at this point .... etc. \" ?\nPlease fill me in.\nBest wishes\nSeymour N. Siegel\nPresident\nana ft"
