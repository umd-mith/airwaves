Although we announced very generally\nthat all ether meetings of the Board wore open to any member\nwho crired to attend, there was still a great deal of ill feeling.\nThe idea of declaring the Bosrd in executive session cam© from\nno one but was the unanimous opinion of every member of the Board.\nThe repercussions were so great that every meeker of the Board\nwas of tire opinion that we would have to announce and publish\nprior to our next Board meeting that all of our meetings were\nopen to any member of the organisation, ^oae wore of the opinion\nthat we could take up only routine matters at the se general\nsessions but that obviously is not the answer. Vie can discuss\ntills more at thd-^ichigan meeting# Thought X should pass it\nalong to you at this time#"
