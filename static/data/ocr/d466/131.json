May I propose that I draft in rather careful\ndetail all of the resolutions which need to be mailed, send out\nthose which are routing, and forward the others to you for revision\nand copying in some elaborate style as was proposed at the conven¬\ntion. O.K.? There are many other matters which I should like\nyour reaction to, but these are of sufficient urgency that I shall\nget this off to you and wait until a later date for the others.\nMy warmest regards always.\nGray donrAusmus, Director\nRadio Broadcasting Services\nManager, WUOA(FM)\nGAspse\ncc: Frank Schooley\nP.S.
