Y.\nFebruary 29, 19^2\nMr. Seymour Siegel\nWNYC\nNew York City, New York\nDear Si:\nThe designation of someone to represent NAEB as an observer to\nthe United Nations is not as simple a matter as it would appear.\nIn the first place, isn't this a spot that would normally be filled\nby the next President or Executive Director? Jim's successor will\nbe named by the middle of April no doubt but the next President will\nnot be named^naturaU^r until the NAEB Fall meeting.\nIf, as you say, \"the time has come\" and we must name someone\nnow, I'd like to suggest Burton Paulu as first choice. I would\nsuggest Bernie Buck as second man except that you will be there to\nrepresent your station and NAEB and it would be well to have some\nother station represented perhaps. Beyond this point, therefore, I\nhave no suggestions.\nGA/ns\ncc: Burton Paulu\nDIRECTOR OF STUDIES\nDALLAS W.
