Dr. Goldschmidt\nhad expected to have his new material—which is virtually\na small book in itself—completed before this; but has had\nto delay the delivery date until later this month. Mean¬\nwhile he has selected a competent artist with an anthrop¬\nological background to prepare illustrations to be used\nthroughout the book. As you can see, THE WAYS OF MANKIND\nwill be an even more elaborate piece of book production\nthan THE JEFFERSONIAN HERITAGE*\nPEOPLE UNDER COMMUNISM is requiring mu‘ch more work within\nthe scripts themselves than has been required on either\nthe Jefferson or the anthropology book. We are working\nwith three key advisers of the Russian Research Center at\nHarvard and in a few weeks will come up with a detailed\nrecommendation for consolidating some of the material and\npossibly for enlarging the whole project to include both\nthe book and a series of pamphlets—drawing on both the\nhour-long programs and the half-hour-long scripts.\nPocketbooks, Inc. has put in a tentative bid for the re¬\nprint lights on THE JEFFERSONIAN HERITAGE.\nIt’s wonderful to know that there is a possibility of\noverseas publications. I think the dignity of your office\nrequires the services of an assistant the next time you\ngo to a meeting in Paris....\nWith very best wishes.\nEver cordially,\n(Signed) Melvin Arnold"
