Indeed, ETV has given strong support to\nand shown its faith in UHF by the construction and operation of\nUHF stations in such cities as Cincinnati* Columbus, Detroit,\nPhiladelphia, Atlanta and Madison, despite the discouraging\nprospects in terms of UHF conversion. Furthermore, ETV is now\nturning to UHF for additional educational service in Pittsburgh}\nand the same may soon be true in several other cities such as\nOklahoma City where a single ETV facility is proving insufficient\nto meet the variety of needs that have developed. It is entirely\nprobable that the utilization of the UHF reservations in New York\nand Los Angeles, and perhaps elsewhere, is dependent upon the\nprior establishment of a VHF educational facility*\nBut what is now most needed for a sound national ETV\nstructure is a program of action that will provide VHF coverage\nin the large cities already mentioned * The JCET will, not be\nalone in moving in this direction. Already the initiative has\nbeen taken locally in New York, Detroit, Rochester and East\nLansing. But the possibilities open in these cities are not\navailable in most of the other \"white areas"
