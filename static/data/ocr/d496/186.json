There is slaply no excuse for an allocation\nsystea that provides for 7 VHF commercial stations and no\nnoncoBBercial station in Hew Tork City.

If so, the only\nsolution Bay be to seek tine-sharing arrangements on the VHF\nchannels now being utilized commercially. This will be a\ncomplicated and difficult matter to work out, but there seems to\nbe no other solution until such time as UHF achieves substantial\nequality with VHF in terms of coverage.\nThere appear to be four alternative methods for the\nprocurement of VHF facilities in these cities, as follows;"
