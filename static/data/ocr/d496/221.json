  "text": "-2-\nIncidentally, I also offered, should affirmative action\non the ETRC’b application be delayed for procedural reasons,\nthat NAEB would be glad to distribute temporarily European\nprograms to its members, who include most of ETRC’s members*\nI hope you approve! If you do not, then don’t hesitate\nto disavow my action. If you do, let’s see that the right\npeople learn of it, so that we gain full credit for my\ngenerous, perhaps rash, and admittedly unauthorized action.\nApropos of all this, I should state that the ETRC and\nanyone else who is considering using continental European\ntelevision films should scrutinize them carefully before\ntelevising them. The samples I saw at the URI meeting in\nParis, as well as here, were pretty sad*\nHere is a matter on which I will need briefing before\nthe Rome EBU meeting of May 27-28 (but for which I shall be\nleaving London on Kay 19). In Paris Mr. Zaffrani of RAI\nasked me, what about NAEB and the Prix Italia. I gave no\nreply, but said I would ask for instructions. Could I have\nsome guidance? What have been our relations with the Prix\nItalia this year? What will they be in the future?\nI have scheduled meetings with the Swedish radio people\non radio programs for NAEB. When these are completed, I’ll\nreport on them.\nBest wishes to you all.\nBPsds"
