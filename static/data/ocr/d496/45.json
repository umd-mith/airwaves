SKORNIA\nFROM: Burton Paulu, President\n(1) A reminder of the announcement I sent you on March 7s \"The\nNAEB Board of Directors will meet in the Deshier-Hilton Hotel in\nColumbus at 8:00 p.m. on the evening of Monday, May 6. There also will\nbe morning, afternoon and evening sessions on May 7* I hope you can\nall be present at all sessions.”\nIf we can complete our business in time to have Tuesday evening\nfree, we shall do so; but since we only have two meetings annually,\nall members should reserve Tuesday evening for the Board, if necessary.\n(2) Board Members and Committee Chairmen should send me by return\nair mail their suggestions for the Board meeting agenda.\n(3) If you have suggestions for the Thursday luncheon program\n(which will be in the nature of short progress reports of general\ninterest), let me have those too.\n(4) Vernon Bronson has invited officers, directors and headquarters\nstaff to a Region II dinner on Tuesday evening, May 7* If our schedule\npermits, it would be nice to attend, although it is hard to foresee now\nwhat stage we shall reach in our deliberations at that time.\nBP: It"
