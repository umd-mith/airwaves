With a\nSeminar to plan, I’d guess we’ve got to find funds for the Research Committee\nto meet as soon as possible in the fall, for a fairly intensive session.--\nThis could be at Saint Louis, perhaps.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nHJS/dfc\nCCi Raymond Cheydlaur\nFrank E. Schooley\nEnclosure! Cheydleur letter of April 18\n\\\n/"
