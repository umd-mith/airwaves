The BBC has no commercial programs.\nWith the possible exception of the broadcasting system of\nRussia, the BBC is the world°s largest broadcasting organization.\nIt runs four domestic radio services, and one television network,\nand also does all of Bi*itain8s international broadcasting. It*s\nstaff includes over 15,000 full time people. It*s annual income\nis in excess of $90,000,000, of which $75,000,000 is for\ndomestic radio and television, and the rest for international\nbroadcasting.\nThe ITA, too, is a public corporation, whose governing\nboard is appointed, and may be dismissed by the government,\nexactly like that of the BBC. It is, of course, supported by\nadvertising, not by license fee proceeds.\nIn view of the fact that it is called the Independent\nTelevision Authority, one may ask, independent of what? Well,\nindependent of really nothing except the BBC. Its relationship\nto the government is almost precisely like that of the BBC?\n-4-"
