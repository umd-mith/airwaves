We are now operating on our second Kellogg grant. It expires\non June 30, 1959. After that date, how will we support those NAEB\nfunctions now underwritten by it?\nTo look for answers Frank Schooley, when president, appointed a\nPermanent Financing Committee consisting of Jim Miles (chairman), Bill\nHarley and Dick Hull. I have reappointed this committee with the same\nmembership plus Ned Rosenheim.\nAttached are the group®s first two reports. Chairman Miles asks that\nthese be distributed to you \"with a note asking strongly for reaction to\nthe proposals and advice to the committee. We honestly do not feel we\ncan go much further with our deliberations until we receive such indications\nof support.\"\nSince the continuance of NAEB at its present or higher levels of\nperformance is entirely contingent upon finding continued financial support,\nplease send Jim Miles your reactions and suggestions!\nBP: It"
