  "text": "\"Mauritius”\n6.\n(Belgian Radio and TV)\nThis three—part series meets the young people’s legitimate need for\nthrilling entertainment in an extraordinary way. It breaches the gap\nbetween the young people’s desire and the conventional detective films\nfor adults by depicting conflict situations and attitudes taken from\nthe sphere of life familiar to youth.\nFour young people are drawn into an adventure revolving around the project\nMauritius.\nBy virtue of its composition and production the programme reaches an\nextraordinary standard,\nNOTES\nAn excellent thriller in the modern vein involving \"flower people\".\nHowever, as all the dialogue is in French, it would not be suitable\nfor use in other languages. Black and white. Duration: 30 minutes.\n\"Knut Kiesowetter Sin^s\" (German Democratic Republic)\nThe programme entertains the spectator on account of its rich repertoire\nand by presenting the well-known German Jazz singer Knut Kiesewetter,\nIt attempts to draw a lively portrait in which artistic self-interpretation\nis related to the demands of the young spectators.\nWhere Beat and Jazz aspire to be regarded as forms of pure art, the artist\nand producer strive to show these forms of art in their proper perspective,\nNOTES\nKnut Kiesewetter is a good singer of the popular style of today,\nbut his attempt to tell his life story and philosophy is not so\ninteresting. This programme would not be so effective in a\nlanguage other than German. Black and white. Duration: 35 minutes."
