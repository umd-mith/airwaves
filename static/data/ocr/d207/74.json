The total\nthus figured would be in excess of $35 million, which would place\nNAEB’s dues at $1,500.\nHowever, NAEB’s own annual budget, derived from dues assessed\nits non-commercial educational institutions is only $325,000. It\nseems to us that a much more equitable basis for determining NAEB\ndues would be to use the total annual operating budget of the\nAssociation - $325,000. As you know, NAEB, unlike most of your\nmembers, is a non-profit, non-commercial organization without any\ngovernment support or subsidy and is dependent upon dues received\nfrom a voluntary membership."
