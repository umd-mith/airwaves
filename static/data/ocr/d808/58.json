Kellogg Foundation\n250 Champion Street\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Maurice:\nre: Your grant letter, just received\nNo secretaries available on Saturdays. And a formal acknowledge¬\nment letter will be sent you early next week. But I did want\nto get this off, even though as written try hand, to thank you\nmost sincerely. All conditions will be observed.\nI wanted to tell you that I feel a little cheap with our special\nrequest report reaching you just after this wonderful development\n-lest we appear greedy. Our effort to meet the date you\nsuggested for presentation of the special project request, February\n1, provides a coincidence in dates about which I!m somewhat shame¬\nfaced. It seems a bit ironic and I wanted you to know we’re not\ninsensitive to this.\nWith deepest appreciation and gratitude.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skarnia\nExecutive Director\nHJS/dp"
