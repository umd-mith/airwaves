In the ensuing few years, the NAEB was able to rally the\nsupport of other organisations for this effort, which culminated first, in\nthe formation of the Joint Council on Educational Television, of which Mr.\nHull was tbs first Executive Director* and secondly in the actual\nallocation for education of 257 channels in the TV spectrum.\nThanks to the efforts of Dean Wilbur Schramm of the University\nof Illinois, assisting the NAEB, finds were secured from the Rockefeller\nFoundation to hold the 19U9 Seminar mentioned above.\nAt the tin© of this seminar in spite of the allocation of EM\nfrequencies for education, there was a growing and sober recognition of\nthe fact that, like AM radio, EM might well again be \"the light that failed.”\nIf the new stations, and the gradual resurgence of educational broadcasting\nin the U.
