As you suggest, there may be time\nwhen we are in Washington for the TV conference for an initial dis¬\ncussion of this matter. Later on we would be glad to have you and\nDr. Harley come by to see us if such a visit seems important.\nThanks for counting me in on the hotel reservations at the DuPont Plaza.\nAs I check my travel schedule for the fall, I have decided to attend\nyour convention from October 27 to 29, arriving the afternoon of the\n27th and leaving the afternoon of the 29th. I am sending in the hotel\nreservation slip which you sent to me. Thanks a lot for your help.\nSincerely and with best wishes.\nMaurice F. Seay\nMFS/fh"
