KELLOGG FCXJHDATION\nFOR PROFESSIONAL ADVANCEMENT PROJECT\nGeneral:\nIt was in 19b9, at the tine of the NATO's first Seminar, at\nAlierton House, that the first awareness began to crystallise in the\nAssociation of the broad and powerful responsibilities and potentialities\nwhich educational broadcasters, as a profession, must realise. Until that\ntimB the NAEB (which had from 1925 to 193b operated as a loose association\nunder the name of The Association of Collage and University Broadcasting\nStations), had had as its major enphas&s government relations and common\nmanagement problems, as was to be expected of an organization operating\nprincipally as a protective association organized to halt the then current\ndecimation of educational radio stations which were in danger of couplets\nextinction. In the fifteen years between 1921 and January 1, 1937 the\ntotal number of educational station licenses in the U.S. had dropped from\n202 to 37o And several of these, in desperate efforts to survive, were\noperating on a commercial or seiid-commercial basis. The mentorship of\nthe AGBS motored only 20 stations in 1933, and by 19bb had risen only to\n23 stations after the change of name of the organization.\nIn the late 1930«s the NAEB, together with the U. S. 0ffr.ce of\nEducation, had fried requests for the reservation of both AM and BM radio\nfrequencies for education in order to protect educational services against\ncommercial onslaughts which they were demonstrably unable to withstand.\nIn its reservations of 1938 and 19b0 the Federal Coranunications Commission\nfinally set aside five channels in the \"CHF” radio band (later designated\nas FM) for education. No reservations were granted for education in AM"
