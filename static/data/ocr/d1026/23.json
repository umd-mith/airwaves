Seay, Director\n, Division of Education\nfWJ\n250 Champion Street\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Maurice;\nEnclosed is a copy of the pilot issue of Educational Radio-TV # just\npublish** by the NAEB.\nlast April, our Board of Directors, realising that there is a real need\nfor a magazine of this soft, ( a need not being filled by any other\nperiodical ), authorised the staff to proceed with the publication of\na pilot issue. It was realised at the time that such a magazine would\ncost a considerable amount of money, but we felt that. If we did not\nfill this veld in the educational broadcasting Held, someone with\npurely commercial interests might well do so* This magasine, as you\ncan see, is intended to serve a function that neither our more scholar¬\nly Journal nor our * ‘family-house-organ • * Newsletter can hope to\nprovide. Ihe advertising space In this pilot issue was sold to some¬\nthing less than actual cost, simply to have an Issue that would reflect\nwhat we have In mind to such a publication if we can establish it cm\na permanent basis.\nWe sincerely believe that such a magazine is the next logical step\nin orderly improvement of our publication program, which has been\npossible during the past two years thanks to the funds provided to\nthis purpose by the W. K* Kellogg Foundation* The $10,000 which has\nbeen earmarked annually in the Kellogg grant to publications has\npermitted us to hire a full-time editor, upgrade the quality of the\nJournal, and make complimentary copies available to educational\nleaders throughout the nation*"
