Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nDuPont Circle Office Building\n13^6 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Bill:\nThe pilot issue of Educational Radio-TV is indeed interesting\nand attractive. We certainly wish for you great success in this\nnew undertaking.\nOn the other hand, a review of our commitments and current\nfields of interest lead to the conclusion that we could not give\nserious consideration to a formal proposal which you might make for\nsupport from this Foundation to aid in financing this new publica¬\ntion.\nI am not sure at this time whether or not I can attend your\nconvention. If I am unable to do this, I will be in Washington\nsometime during the fall months and hope to visit with you.\nSincerely and with best wishes.\nMaurice F. Seay\nMFS:jf\nOCT 5 1961\ni"
