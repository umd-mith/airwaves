My\nmany TV discussions with him have convinced me that h© had\nalready made great s trides la acquiring T? knowledge when 1\nsold the station late in 1952.\nMr. Bonvouloir is head and shoulders abavo the average engineer\nwith a thirst for knowledge of programming and all other\nfactors that enter into the effective operation of a broadcast\nstation,\nI can recommeiad him without limitation for the position you\nobviously have in sited 0\nVery truly ynars,\nfa/ Bruff W.
