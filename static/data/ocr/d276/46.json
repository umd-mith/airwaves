How*\never, we did not feel it wise or desirable to daisy our statement to you soy\nlonger0 Final developments in this inter-organizational area can still be\nprovided you in say case in the oral discussions which will undoubtedly be\nnecessary prior to final decisions on the part of the W. K. Kellogg Founda¬\ntion®\nHerewith, therefore, the statement of our plans and situation as\nfar as it is now possible to provide it,\nHiring the past year several steps have been taken to explore the\nextent to which the NAEB can reasonably expect to achieve economic self-\nsupport®\nThe dues structures of many other collar able membership-based\norganizations have been secured and studied® New dues structures for the\nNAEB have been proposed to the Board, discussed and referred back for fur¬\nther study® Investigations have been undertaken of the possibility of in¬\ncreasing the presently modest income of the Association from the sale of\nrecords and record albums by issuing additional albums and by promoting\ngeneral retail sale to supplement sales presently handled through educa¬\ntional channels®"
