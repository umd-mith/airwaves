Receiver\nadapters cost about $70 each or a complete receiver for the subcarrier channel\nsells for about $100. Transmitting equipment is manufactured by the Gates Company\nand receiving equipment by the Browning Laboratories.\nThe NAEB Engineering Committee is presently working on various types\nof networks to supplement the tape network and the FM multiples system may offer\na solution to the problem in certain areas. However, as the range of the multiplex\nsystem is the same as the present FM transmitter range, distances between member\nstations is too great to organise a practical national network or even a regional\nnetwork in any but a few localities. Local networks in some areas do appear to be\na possibility.
