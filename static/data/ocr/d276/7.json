Over-all color and picture\nstability seems good once proper parometers have been arrived at. Asking prices\nfor the equipment is low as compared with that of other color pickup apparatus\npresently available.\nContrasting these factors* however* is the inescapable conclusion that the\nsystem as proposed lacks the acid test of extended trail and use under actual\noperating conditions. All in all the system deserves sincere scrutiny and interest\non the part of all potential users until such a time as its scope and effectiveness\ncan be determined,\nLOW-POWER - LOW COST TELEVISION INSTALLATICM;\nOne of the newest innovations in the television industry today is the low\npower-low cost television transmitter installation. Two companies demonstrated\nthese transmitters. They were the Bage Television Company and the Adler Commun\nications Laboratory. Package units* consisting of antenna, transmitter* control\nconsole, vidicon live and film pick-up mechanisms* were being offered for a little\nover $ 50,000.00, The transmitter power outputs ranged from 150 to 200 watts\npeak power output in both the vhf and ulif speetrums.
