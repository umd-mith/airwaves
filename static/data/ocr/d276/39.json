For all\npractical purposes it has already been approved by the Center, ACE, and\nNCCET. It carries endorsement of JCET chairmane I recommend approval\nby NAEB.\nNow a few comments, as document speaks pretty well for itself.\nEssentially, this is a policy document. Obviously, some administrative\ndetails remain to be worked out. If adopted, trio working out in first\ninstance probably becomes Newburn, Jorgensen, and Schooley, as you* 11\nnote.\nThis document was arrived at at two different meetings, with\nessentially same people present at both. It is, I believe in principle,\nwhat NAEB Board agreed it could agree on. One minor point, our Board\nhad divided opinion on JCET or JGSB. The ** compact group” had rather\nstrong feelings on JCET. I did not oppose, but insisted that ^Committee”\nbe changed to nCouncil,w and that the Washington office was to represent\nboth the radio and television interests of both NAEB and the Center.\nThis was agreed upon unanimously.\nI shall be glad to answer questions, furnish additional informa¬\ntion. Meanwhile, I urge a fast reply from you so I can give an early\nNAEB decision. Also, I trust you911 treat this with some confidence\nso that we are in no way responsible for rocking the boat.\nFES:wc\nEnclosure: (1)\ncc: Cohn & Marks\nRichard B. Hull"
