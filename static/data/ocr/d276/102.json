  "text": "possible secondary and suggestibility effects on the listening audience. For\nthis reason careful consultant checking by qualified psychologists was well as mental\nhealth, psychosomatic, and psychiatric specialists will be required.\nThis area also lends itself less well to problem areas or program titles\nwithout becoming fairly technical. It is expected that programs and heading\nmight, more than in most cases, be determined by available subject materials such\nas might be found at the Msnninger Clinic, or at the psychiatric clinics of some\nof our large universitites.\nMr. Harry Milt, Director of Public Relations for The National Association for\nMental Health, Inc., of 1790 Broadway, New York 19, New York, and Mr. Jack Nefcer of\nthe Mental Health Materials Center, at the same address, have urged that we arrange\nfor a meeting with them there for adequate consultation which they do not feel\ncan be adequately done by mail. At that time lists of consultants can be finalised.\nDr. Rudolph G. Noviek, Psychiatric Consultant to the Illinois Society of Mental\nHealth is one whose name has been favorably mentioned. He has indicated in a letter\nto me his interest and willingness to cooperate, subject to further discussions in\nperson. Others suggested include Dr. Dana Farnsworth of Harvard University, Mr.\nJack Glidervell of St. Louis, Dr. Qjemann of Iowa State, Mr. Robert Sutherland of\nthe Hogg Foundation of Austin, and a representative of the National Congress of the\nPTA, which is also planning a project in Mental Health. As indispensable possible\nresource people the following would also need to be consulted;\nDr. Karl A. Msnninger\n(Home address; 1819 Westwood Circle, Topeka, Kansas5\nOffice; J&nninger Clinic Building, Topeka, Kansas)\nDr. Roy R. Grinker\n(Home address; 4940 East End Avenue, Chicago, Illinois\nOffice: Michael Reese Hospital, 29th & Ellis Ave., Chicago 16, HI.)"
