  "text": ">17-\nWOI~TV-~-\nIf the workshop we is given again, I would like to see more time allotted to specific\nproblems and fewer subjects undertaken* In some cases, more than one hour should be\nallowed depending on the individual speaker and the subject* The number of general\nsubjects should be more limited* In short, there was too much material to cover in\none week*\nVfy main hope in attending this workshop was to talk to other people in the field of\nvideo recording to find out just where I stood* It was very reassuring to find that\nothers have had the same problems and that I was on the right track* I did not find\nany single solution for making excellent kine recordings but I feel that it is within\nthe grasp of the group represented at this meeting if we only had some way of coordi¬\nnating our efforts and pooling our knowledge* The knowledge we have is spread too\nfar and too thin* Many of the individuals most capable of solving these problems\nare burdened with other duties and cannot spare the time* Progress will continue to\nbe slow as long as each station independently tries to solve the same problems*\nJams8 Ho Johnson\nWayne University—\nThe following comments comprise a \"Workshop Members Evaluation Report\" as requested:\n1° Changes in organization or set~up or Workshop ~ I think the workshop was very well\norganized* The only^SBG^Hculiy f“had was' that some of the speakers had to leave\nearly and wa had such short breaks that I could not get to talk to them* I think\nthat, if a little more time was allowed between speakers, things would be better*\n2C Expectations - My main objective in attending the workshop was to meet other en~\ngineerso !Efxis I did and I found it most inspiring to talk to someone who has the\nsame problems I have even if I could not find answers to all my problems*\n3° Operation of Equipment ~ Actual operation of equipment is of course desirable but\najLecture demonstration of equipment is also good* I think the lighting demon®\nstration with the model and live camera was most effective* I think an actual\ndemonstration of a staircase waveform generator would have bean most helpful in\nconnection with a kinescope recording*\nUc Other Comments - none\n5c Ways NAEB Engineering Service can help - I find that the members of the Wayne\nW \"MaSTare uninfo nrecT\"about certain aspects of TV engineering* I believe that\ncertain articles on TV engineering should be selected to be read by non-engineer¬\ning members of TV staffs* The production people should know and understand the\nlimitations and possibilities of Tv equipment* This information should come from\nNAEB to be authoritative.\nKeith Kossuth"
