I did feel that we tried to do too much in too little time* Per¬\nhaps the same amount of work in a couple more days would be better* I felt\na little too much pressure*\nSo I am very appreciative of the service extended by the NAEB Engineering service*\nI have found it competent and willing to help with every request* Perhaps\nnew bulletins and brochures of companies available could be listed in a spe¬\ncial section of news letter and made available on request*\nCo D. Phillips\n# * * >> •* * * *\nWILL-TV—\n1* The organisation was very good and things moved along with a very good pace*\nI like having things proceed as scheduled* I feel that the '’bull sessions\" after\nhours were very helpful for me*\n2* My expectations of the workshop were of a general nature, just to learn of\nother people ?s problems and to find out how they solved them* This was very ade¬\nquately fulfilled*\n3a Operation of equipment would have been of little importance to me since I can\ndo that here at work* I do think that all engineers should be encouraged to tell\nof any unusual experiences with their equipment, via both the news letter and the\nworkshop roundtable discussions,\nho This may seem odd to mention but I think more people would speak at the round\ntable discussions if we all sat around a large table so we could all take notes\neasily and a moderator would control speaking to one person at a time*\nSo The engineering service could help me via a publication of general practices\nregarding air time, kine time, maintenance time, etc,, vs* total man hours so that\nwhen we are asked the cost of a show, or special servi.ee we can give a more spe¬\ncific answer* Wages vs* schooling, security, etc* for engineers in the educational\nfield could also be a help to hire and keep good engineers in this field*\nClarence Berbanm\nWB J C~FM—\n1- Suggested changes in the set-up, organisation etc*, for the future workshop*\nIn light of my past workshop experiences; I could now profit by attending\na workshop, held at an educational center, where the student body or the community\nwas active in participating in the operation of the station* I would like to"
