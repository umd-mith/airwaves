Planning Committee ^\nFROM: Marguerite Fleming\nYou will recall that at the last meeting of the entire\nIn-School Committee we talked about trying to get sane special\nschool programs ready for distribution and hoped that we could\nget materials from other countries as well as our own. The en¬\nclosed copies of letters indicate that our efforts are beginning\nto pay off.\nAlso in New York some of you joined us to talk with Dr.\nRandall concerning the types of programs we could use if they\nwere directed to young people. We have just heard his two pro¬\ngrams in the new series, THIS IS A FRIENDLY WORLD and can recom¬\nmend them highly. They are well done sofar as content is con¬\ncerned and the technical quality is much better than last years*\nseriea I hope this series is offered fcy one of the school or\nthe adult network this year.\nHave you any suggestions as to anything that the planning :\nsection of the In-School Committee could or diould be doing\nbefore convention? 1*11 be glad to relay your suggestions to\nJohn.\nMF:s"
