Ola will not arrive\nuntil Thursday morning, February 10, at 9*50 or possibly 11*00 a.m.\nRegarding the handbooks, I agree that something is wrong with\nthe way in which they are handled and that we should talk about the\nproblem. They are delivered to the stations, because they are sent out\nwith the order blanks. If a station orders & series, it must have re¬\nceived the handbook. If we have extra number of handbooks left over\nafter the offering, we keep them on hand for an indeterminate number of\nmonths—in case a station writes for an extra copy. Off hand, I think\nthat the only thing we can do is to impress stations that they must\nhang onto these books until they definitely know that they are through\nwith a series or are not going to us© it at all. But that*s an impromptu\nidea—a repeat of your own suggestion—and perhaps we111 come up with\nsomething else at our meeting.\nSincerely,\nJohn R. Holt\n_ Network Manager\nJRHsvc"
