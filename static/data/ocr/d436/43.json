Since I had not applied myself to this\ncommittee before (and there was a lot we didn’t know until then)\nI had assumed that everything was somewhat dormant. Because\nKen Wright sounded apprehensive, too, the night before, I would\nassume that your information and invigorating presence were\nthe crucial ingredients.\nThe meeting started the wheels rolling in my mind for\nsomething here which I might approach you about later.\nThanks for everything.\nLee Eitzen"
