  "text": "By 1950, out of'the 8,300,00 youth not in school or college, 5*700*000 were actually in\nthe labor force. They constituted less than one-tenth of the existing labor force of\nnearly sixty million.\nThe evidence as to steady growth in productivity per capita is not so dramatic as the\nevidence on the shift of youth from1the labor force to formal education, but the main reason\nfor the lack of such evidence is the difficulty of deriving a single figure which will be a\ntrue index covering all productivity of all workers* The Office of Business Economics of\nthe Department of Commerce estimates that per capita productivity has increased since 1929\nat an average rate of 2% per annum* Since this is consistent with figures drawn from some\nstill unpublished research showing that productivity per capita has increased annually at\nthe average rate of 1*9$ since 1873, it seems safe to use this as the evidence substantiat¬\ning this point*\nThe evidence as to the expansion of the economy in terms of capital investment is\nalso difficult to come by* However, again, the Office of Business Economics produces a\nfigure showing a reinvestment of 11$ of the gross national product in 1953, which in turn\nis consistent with a figure of 154$ of similar reinvestment in 1929* While it is perhaps\ndangerous to apply these figures throughout this century, they can be taken as evidence\nthat such reinvestment was going on during the period under consideration* As a matter of\nfact,.it may be that we do not need formal evidence of the existence of this reinvestment*\nCertainly, the financial pages give daily evidence that such reinvestment is going on,\neven though they, like the meager statistics available, give us very little information in\nterms of trends or percentages*\nIt is difficult to say that the evidence supporting these four phenomena establishes\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that they are all in some measure the results of the replacement\nof apprenticeship by education* However, I think that an examination of the results of\nwhat has been in fact a revolution in education will supply the evidence that the statistics\ncannot*\nConsider for a moment what would have happened if the revolution had not taken place.\nIn that case, as of 1950, out of our 17,14.00*000 youth we should have had only 1,270,000\nin school or college, 16,100,000 available for the labor force, and 11,800,000 actually\nin the labor force. This would have meant that the youth in the labor force would be\ndouble the number we actually'have, and that the labor force itself would be increased\nfrom 60 million to 66 million* This would mean, in turn, that, even assuming the\nmaintenance of our present total output, the productivity per capita would be considerably\ndiminished* And almost certainly, this, in turn, would mean that the amount of the gross\nnational product available for reinvestment for the expansion of the economy would be\nmuch smaller than the 11$ which was so available only three years ago*\nThis argument can, of course, be carried a good deal farher* If we had not enlarged\nour educational system, then the producing and distributing segments of the economy would\nthemselves have had to carry the burden of educating their workers through a form of\napprenticeship, and would themselves have had to do all of the work of identifying potential\nleaders, in order to man an expanding economy that had discovered and was perfecting the\n?frs °f ™ass Production and mass distribution* And this, in turn, would have meant that\nhaZB beenan additional charge against operating costs, which, in turn,\nuld still further have reduced the amount of the gross national product available for\nreinvestment *"
