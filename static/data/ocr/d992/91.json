Most\nschools, private and public, get most resources from nearby areas. In¬\nstitution which can bid highest has best ability to attract and hold.\nB) J, Lee Rankin, Assistant Attorney General\nBackground on Herbert Brownells\nBrother Sam is Commissioner of Education\nFather was a teacher at Nebraska for many years.\nRankin - represented anti\"-segregation in hearings. He was also from\nNebraska, (Department of Public Instruction).\nSupreme court can never give advisory opinion, (as they told George\nWashington). Can only give opinion in cases and these must reach them\nthrough lower courts.\nLegal basis: Ibth Amendment, adopted in 1868. lbth Amendment understood\nto establish full equality of all before the law. In 1880 Strouter case,\nSupreme Court denied request for excusing Negroes from serving on juries.\n1896—re rail segregation: Segregation in public places not considered\nabsence of equality. Equal, not same. (Plessy case, Louisiana)\nBerea College case, 1908, upheld right to keep Negroes out.\n1939—Justice Hughes said sending Negro out of state didn*t satisfy, if\nlaw courses for example, available to whites. No state can be excused\nby what another state can do. Equality of faculty implied; for law,\nfaculty members who are members of bar association, opportunity to dis¬\ncuss with other lawyers.\nFinally in 195b Plessy case definitely reversed. Five cases were involved\nin which Negro children had been denied access to certain schools.\nSeparate facilities are inherently unequal, according to last (195b) deci¬\nsion!"
