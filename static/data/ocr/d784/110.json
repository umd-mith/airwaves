I feel that Headquarters and\nNetwork should report often enough to keep the Board informed but not too\noften to become a burden either on the writer or the readers. Therefore,\nI make the following:\nPROPOSAL:- THE NAEB HEADQUARTERS AND TAPE NETWORK SHALL MAKE A DETAILED ANNUAL\nREPORT WHICH WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE BOARD, MEMBERS, AND FOUNDATION. THEY\nSHALL ALSO PREPARE QUARTERLY, NARRATIVE AND FINANCIAL REPORTS FOR SUBMISSION TO\nTHE BOARD."
