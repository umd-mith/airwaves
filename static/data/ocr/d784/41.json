We proved to ourselves that we could\noperate a conference in a helpful way without any so-\ncalle d ’big shots ’ •n\nIn the matter of regional meetings, as with everything\nelse it attempted this past year, the educational broadcasting pro¬\nject was experimental. It was a shake-down year. To get a true\nperspective on the problems faced and solved by this activity, it\nis perhaps wise to turn briefly to history.\nThe idea of educational broadcasting was born at the same\ntime the technical problems of broadcasting were solved# Early in\nthe 1920’s people began talking about the great potentialities for\nmass education via radio. Some who thought of radio as a panacea\nto all educational problems soon lost some of their enthusiasm\nwhen broadcasting didn’t fall into the accustomed and time-tested\neducational patterns.\nA group of the stouter-hearted individuals who realized\nthat radio would be important in its long term aspect continued\nto broadcast and to talk about the present accomplishments and\neven greater potentialities of the new medium#\nThis organization of the 20’s, feeling the need for a\nstronger association, formed and activated NAEB in 193li« During\nthe years prior to the advent of FM, NAEB continued to serve as\nthe focal point for the exchange of information among those\ninterested in educational broadcasting# The end of the war and\nthe opening of the FM band with its allocation of 20 percent of\nthe FM channels for educational purposes — largely at the insti¬\ngation of NAEB — meant that the possibilities for the growth of\neducational broadcasting were now increased many fold#"
