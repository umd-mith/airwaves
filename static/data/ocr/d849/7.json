The Japan America Philharmonic Orchestra which made its\ndebut not long ago. Tell us something about this combined effort.\nThe orchestra consists of two halves of unequal size and complexion—\na string body of 60 Japanese musicians, and an American group of 36\nwind and percussion players. John Barnett ( ass't conductor of the\nLos Angeles Symphony has welded this group together).
