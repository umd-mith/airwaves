Thank to this unfortunate chance, it has\nhad farm and building land requisitioned by the authorities on\neleven separate occasions! The process began with the\nestablishment of the former Japanese Arrcy*s Tachikawa flying\nschool in 1926, and ended for the time being in November 1954*\ninvolving in all some 460*000 tsubo (about 375 acres) of land.\nThe Japanese Government paid compensation on each occasion*,\nbut not once was it enough to satisfy the inhabitants.
