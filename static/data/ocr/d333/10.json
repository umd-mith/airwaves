I am well aware of the problems which have\nbeset your committee in attempting to secure and audition programs for\nthe in-school service, this being one of our most **difficult-to-provide'*\nservices.\nSince you had indicated to Harold Hill and Bob Underwood your desire\nnot to be renamed to this committee and had placed it third on the list\nof committee preferences you sent in, I felt we should abide by your\nwishes, although I know Bob and the committee will miss your giuding hand*\nI also want to thank you for your indicated willingness to serve in any com¬\nmittee capacity which we felt would be most helpful to the Association •\nI was pleased to be able to place you on the committee indicated as your\nfirst preference. It is your devotion, and that of the other committee chair¬\nmen and members, which gives the NAEB its true strength.\nSincerely,\nWilliam G • Harley"
