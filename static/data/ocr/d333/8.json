  "text": "At the intermediate grade level we have a series Let’s Talk It Over which con¬\ntinues the How You Talk pattern. I’ve submitted it before and heard nothing.\nCritical comment as to why a series is rejected would be helpful. This one is\nplanned by, written by, talent by, and produced by Dorothy Matheny who also had\nthe idea for How You Talk, researched it, stimulated Dr. Hawk into doing it,\nproduced it, edited it. In view of the paucity of material in remedial speech\nareas, perhaps a series like this should have an analysis in depth of its short¬\ncomings for network use. It is doing a job for us, we could revise it if its\nfaults aren’t basic, but if they are we need that opinion.\nDo you plan to listen to programs at the Columbus meeting? I know that we won’t\nhave much time, but I don’t believe that a list of criteria is half so helpful\nas listening to a program. If it communicates—even though it violates all the\ncritical canons—why should we reject it?\nSincerely,\n/■/\nHarry D. Lamb\nDirector\nhdl/jb\nCC: Robert Underwood,Jr,"
