Y.\nDear Sirs:\nA student in the Department of Social Sciences at\nBoston College Graduate School, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts,\nI am doing research in the development of Educational\nTelevision. The research paper, in connection with a\ncourse in Educational Sociology, seeks to not only uncover\nthe factors leading to the use of television as an\neducational tool, but to point up positive and negative\nreactions and effectiveness of the medium to date.\nAny assistance your committee might be able to give\nme by way of promotional materials and sources for further\nstudy would be most appreciated.\nVery truly yours.\nx"
