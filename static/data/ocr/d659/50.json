It is\nnot possible at present, nor does it seem desirable to attempt to outline the full\nscope of the things that may be done because the teachers themselves will be par¬\nticipating continuously in the planning and in the making of decisions.\nWhile much of the first year must be devoted to an orientation of teachers to the\nnew medium and to the designing of ways of providing effective instruction, it is\nintended that the scope of what is attempted be broad and comprehensive from the\nvery start of the project. It is, therefore, proposed that ways of implementing the\nprogram include simultaneous developments in the following areas: (1) Direct in¬\nstruction, (2) Supplemental instruction, (3) In-service teacher training, and (4)\nPublic relations.\nThe following chart shows the plan for developing these areas beginning in Septem¬\nber, 1956.\nAREAS OF CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION PROJECT 1956-60\nSept.\n1956\nDIRECT\nINSTRUCTION\nSUPPLEMENTAL\nINSTRUCTION\nIN-SERVICE\nTEACHER TRAINING\nPUBLIC RELATIONS\nPARENT GROUPS\nGeneral Science 9\nScience\nPresentation\nSpecial programs\nPlane Geometry 10\ndemonstrations\nof professional\nshowing\nFilins\nmaterial to\nschool\nU.
