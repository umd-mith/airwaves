This does remind one that there\nis usually some difference of opinion on every question.\nOf course, I do not agree that the inclusion of digests of\npertinent radio research would \"look like padding\" . It\nseems to me that anyone who is interested in information\nabout radio would appreciate the additional items rather than\nresent their inclusion.\nAs I now understand it, you have been including the radio\ndigests that have been available to you as bonus sheets or\nextra items of special interest. I agree that this is a\nsatisfactory approach until more radio research renorts\nreach you. After all, the only thing that matters is that\nwe get information on whatever radio research is being re¬\nported .\nYour usual careful attention to the subject is appreciated.\nSir^e^el^^-\nGale E. Adkins\nDirector\nGHAjpf\nEnel. 1"
