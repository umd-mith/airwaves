Skornia\nExecutive Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Dr. Skornia:\nWe are very glad to have your letter of January 17 addressed\nto our Commissioner of Education, Dr. J. W. Edgar. As you\ncan well imagine, those of us in Texas are very glad to tell\nother people of the project we are now conducting in the field\nof teacher recruitment and education by television. We believe\nthe project has been very successful thus far, and we are now\nlooking forward to continuing it during a second year. We heard\nfrom Dr. Eurich yesterday, telling us that the Board of the Fund\nhas just approved our application for a second year. This, of\ncourse, makes all of us very happy and we are making ambitious\nplans for continuing the project.\nI am enclosing a copy of the Project Statement which has changed\nto a slight degree in some areas since the program started in\nSeptember. It was on this statement that we based our begin¬\nning; however, we do feel that we have made considerable progress\nduring the first six months. We shall be very glad to send you\nas much information as is now available, and if you will send me\none of your Fact Sheets, we shall be glad to complete it. This\nwill guide me in knowing more directly what you would like to\nhave said about the project.\nI am looking forward to seeing you again at Dectona Beach early\nin June.\nSincerely yours,\nLee Wilborn\nAssistant Commissioner\nfor Instruction\nLW: sw"
