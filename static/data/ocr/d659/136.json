A\nsubscription would cost you $2,50 per year.\nWe regret that we must make a charge for such materials\nbut as a membership-based organization # we find that we must try to\nrecover part of the cost of preparing and issuing such reports. I am en¬\nclosing a list of the materials we have available for sale. If there is any\nthing listed which you feel will be helpful, just ail out the carder form\nand send it along with a check made out to die National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters. The materials will be mailed the same day the\norder is received.\nSincerely,\nEnclosure\nV\n(Mrs.) Judith B. Gans\nSecretary"
