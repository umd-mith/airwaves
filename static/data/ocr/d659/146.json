Richard Krolik, recently\nwith NBC’s Wide, Wide World and Today,\nand former director of TV activities for\nLife magazine, heads the new office.\nEstablishment of the TV-radio branch to\nmaintain liaison with network officials and\nproducers is a step in NEA’s expanded serv¬\nice program adopted at the Centennial Con¬\nvention in Philadelphia. More than 1,200,000\neducators will give their active support to\n“quality programming in the public inter¬\nest” on commercial TV and radio, predicts\nEA Executive Secretary William G. Carr.\nThe new TV-radio office will cooperate\nwith producers in presenting aspects of edu¬\ncation on their programs. Research facilities\nof NEA’s Washington headquarters will be\navailable for shows that will deal with\nschools, teachers, the needs of children and\nyouth, and allied topics.\nAn example of the type of programming\nthat can stem from NEA cooperation with\nthe networks is the “Back to School” salute\nto be aired on Monitor, the morn-to-mid-\nnight NBC radio show, September 6-7-8. In\nthe biggest sustained salute to America’s\n30 million school children ever to hit the\nair waves, the show will devote a solid week¬\nend to “Back-to-School” news, interviews,\nfeatures, and special events.\nNote to AASA members: When you or\nyour staff like what you see or hear over\nradio or television—particularly when you\nfind such programs useful in regular class¬\nroom work or discussion—let your local sta¬\ntion, the network, or the sponsor hear from\nyou. You will get more station managers\nand more sponsors thinking seriously about\ntop-quality public service programming.\nReport of Studies\nIn School Administration\nMailed to AASA Members\nA new book by Hollis A. Moore, Jr., en¬\ntitled Studies in School Administration, has\nbeen published by the AASA Committee for\nthe Advancement of School Administration.\nIts two purposes are, first, to summarize\nmajor accomplishments in the improvement\nof school administration which can be traced\nto the Cooperative Program in Educational\nAdministration (CPEA) ; second, to bring\ninto one volume an annotated bibliography\nof all important publications issued by re¬\ngional CPEA centers or by other cooperat¬\ning groups and institutions.\nThe 202-page book was mailed to AASA\nmembers in July.

This is\nthe opinion of C. C. Trillingham, AASA\npresident-elect and superintendent of Los\nAngeles (Calif.) County schools, whose of¬\nfice sponsored a workshop in the Los Nietos\nSchool District, July 15-19, for more than\n100 superintendents and principals in school\ndistricts of Los Angeles County. Joint spon¬\nsor was the Los Angeles County School Ad¬\nministrators and Supervisors Association.\nDean Irving R. Melbo of the school of\neducation, USC, spoke on “The Adminis¬\ntrator’s Responsibilities in Relation to the\nInstructional Program.” Other topics in¬\ncluded home-school relationships, supervi¬\nsion of instruction, effective curriculum\npractices, and staff relationships.\nLater in the month, at Stanford Univer¬\nsity, over 100 school superintendents at¬\ntended the first school administrators clinic\nin a series planned by the California Asso¬\nciation of School Administrators and uni¬\nversities in the state. It was held July 29\nto August 2, under the chairmanship of\nProfessor William R. Odell of the Stan¬\nford School of Education. Instructional im¬\nprovement, effective community procedures,\nplanning school buildings, development of\nadministrative personnel, and school staff\nand community morale were studied.\nLATE FLASH: Watch for the September\n21 issue of The Saturday Evening Post (on\nthe newsstands Sept. 17) with two articles\nanswering the question, “Are the Public\nSchools Doing Their Job?”\n“No,” says John Keats, a free-lance\nwriter who is sending his three children\nto a private school this fall.\n“Yes,” declares Herbert L. Brown, Jr.,\nmanaging editor of Changing Times, and\nfather of two: “The American public-school\nsystem is demonstrating a notable superior¬\nity over private schools.”\nBe an Angel\nand Remind Your School Architect. . . .\ndeadline for receiving entry blanks for re¬\ngional school building architectural exhibits\nis SEPTEMBER 16.\n(Rules and regulations along with entry\nblanks for all three AASA conventions were\nmailed to AASA members on August 15.\nAdditional copies may be obtained from\nAASA headquarters upon request.)"
