We now are paying members. We must charge\nall organizations to whom we, on our part, pay annual dues or fee. We are sorry\nbut if you wish to continue receiving our R*ct Sheets, you will have to pay the #2.50\nfee. You will be billed by the University. As I mentioned earlier, if you do not\nwish to pay this nominal charge, then please return the postcard or drop me a note.\nI hope this has not been too much of an inconvenience. We hope that we\nmay continue to have the privilege of serving you.\nSincerely,\nblcc: H. U. Skomia\n(Mrs.) Jhdith B. Gans\nSecretary"
