The instant proposal\ndoes not contain sufficient safeguards for this purpose, and,\ntherefore, the NAEB urges that careful consideration be given to\nthis problem for the reasons set forth in the following para-\ngraphs.\n6. At the present time the only protection against inter-\nference for television service consists of the Commissions\nminimum mileage separation requirements. In no case has the\nCommission deviated from the firm position that the mileage sep¬\narations, and nothing but the mileage separations, determine the\nextent of service of a television station. The mileage separa¬\ntions, in turn, are based upon full utilisation of the facilities\nprovided in the allocation table. The instant proposal presents\nthe first situation in which the Commission is willing to deviate\nfrom this policy, and this proposed deviation contains the seed\nfor adulteration of the television allocation system. For the\ninstant proposal contains a concept of \"interference” based on\nother considerations than mileage separations. Paragraph 8 of\nthe instant Notice of Proposed Rule Making indicates that the\npower limitation for the proposed service is one which will en¬\nsure a minimum amount of interference to other radio services\nand direct reception from television broadcast stations. How¬\never, the proposed rules go further. The proposed Section 4.903\n(a) requires a showing by an applicant for a low power VHF\nbooster that it will not cause interference to the reception of\nany existing broadcast or non-broadcast station. However, inter-\nference, as used in this section, is nowhere defined. Unless\n37 The definition of interference contained in proposed Section\n4.903(h) is obviously of no use in applying Section 4.903(a)."
