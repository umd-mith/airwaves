In accordance with the\nCommission’s desires, attention is directed to the questions outlined in\nSections 8 and 9 of the aforementioned release.\nSection 8(1)\n,jWhether every 6 months during the first 3 years\nthat remote control is authorised, the Commission\nshould require submission of a skeleton proof of\nperformance to show that the antenna system meets\nthe terms of the license, and thereafter the sub¬\nmission of a skeleton proof with each license\nrenewal application;”\nIt is believed that during the first three years that remote\ncontrol operation of a directional antenna system is authorised that two\nskeleton proof of performance checks at six month intervals for the first\nyear should be required, and providing these are satisfactory, then yearly\nchecks would be sufficient to determine compliance with the terms of the\nlicense for the remaining part of the period. In the alternative the\nsuggested six month provision would apply. Reports on these checks should\nInclude details of corrective measures undertaken and magnitude of departure\nfound to exist from the license criteria, if any. Following this introductory\nperiod a skeleton proof of performance should be submitted with each renewal\nof license application.\nSection 8(2)\n’’Whether the Commission should require the logging of loop\ncurrent ratios rather than base current ratios and how\noften readlngs~should be made and logged;17\n1"
