Like previous NAEB\nRegional meetings, this Conference was made possible by funds from the W. K. Kellogg\nFoundation.\nThe purpose of this regional meeting was to give the NAEB members in Region I\nan opportunity to discuss common problems, ask pertinent questions of Headquarters\nrepresentatives, get complaints off their chests, and engage in the sort of frank\ndiscussion which larger conferences or open conventions do not permit.\nIn general, NAEB members have stated that this is the type of conference they\nprefer, and the type they have gotten most out of at other regional meetings.\nThis meeting brought together NAEBers from Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Mary¬\nland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,\nVermont in addition to Dr. Harry J. Skornia, NAEB Executive Director, and Mr. Cecil\nBidlack, NAEB TV Engineer, from the headquarters staff in Urbana, Illinois.\nThe Conference Committee extended to each delegate a hearty invitation to attend\nthis conference and earnestly hoped it would contribute to the personal development\nin the educational Radio-TV field of every individual participating.\nThe joint committee which, in cooperation with the NAEB Headquarters staff,\nplanned the conference was composed of Dr. Harry M. Lyle, Massachusetts Board\nof Educational Television! Professor Anthony W, Zaitz, WMUA, University of Massachu¬\nsetts! and Professor W. Worcester Smith, Western Massachusetts Educational Television\nCouncil, Inc. These three also served as co-hosts for the conference."
