  "text": "8,\nFirst General Session:\nFrederick B. Robinson, President of the Western Massachusetts Educational\nTelevision Council, Inc*, served as chairman. In reporting on Council activities,\nthe Chairman stated, in part, that: ’’Until recently, we have concentrated on\nlimiting the WMETV to educators. The main problem with professional educators is\nthey are limited in training and background and do not look at a problem as the\naverage person would look at it. Therefore, the Council is now going to include\nbusinessmen, first because of their possible financial aid and second to develop\na wider awareness of the new media of mass communication for a broad understanding\nof education. Most of our money has come from small institutions in this area,\nwho are allowed to give such funds in small amounts. Nevertheless, during these\ntwo years that the Council has been in existence, we have made many agencies in this\npart of the state aware of what can be done in TV if we could get our own station.\n’’Last spring, an excellent conference was held and out of this grew another\ngroup interested in telecasts. These are now being offered over commercial stations\nby calling on teachers of the area to provide programs.\n”We now depend on commercial stations for time which may be from 2:15 to 2:30\nor 2:45, but it is a doubtful procedure and difficult to depend on the commercial\nstations for free time. Therefore, we must increase the awareness of the potential\nof ETV for adult education and in-school training. This stimulates better teach¬\ning through good teaching methods on TV. The aim is not to eliminate teachers\nbut to supplement them, and with this stimulation add to the value of education.\nIf we have accomplished nothing else, the Council is at least bringing this\nawareness.”\nThe chairman then introduced Dr. Harry J. Skornia, NAEB Executive Director."
