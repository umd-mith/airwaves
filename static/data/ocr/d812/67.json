Here are some things you, with the\nhelp of other civic groups, can do effectively:\n1. Know the local station’s programs.\n2. Decide what kind of shows you want,\nand why.\n3. Interest other community groups to\nwork with you.\n4. Tell your local station what you\nwant.\n5. Be constructive and practical.\nIt’s no good calling all current shows of a\nkind “terrible”. They aren’t. Shows like\n“Mr. Wizard” (science), “Through the En¬\nchanted Gate” (arts), Mr. I. Magination\n(story-telling), ‘lelaventure Tales.” (books)\n“Zoo Parade” — all are top entertainment\nand good value for the viewers. Take the\ntime to follow your local station for at least\na month and log the good, bad, and indif¬\nferent.\nDo your viewing (of children’s programs)\nwith your children as often as possible. Lis¬\nten to their opinions of the shows. Find out\nthrough your local papers or the TV trade\npapers such as “Variety” and fan magazines\nsuch as “TV Guide” what other shows exist\nfor children.\nTAKE THE LEAD. Enlist the aid of\nScouts, Camp-Fire Girls, schools, churches,\nPTA’s, women’s clubs, and other groups.\nTake the lead in organizing these groups to\nlook and evaluate and form a program of\nimprovement with you. One voice—even\nthe voice of one organization—is a lost\nvoice. When all interested community groups\ncombine to plead the same case, action will\nresult.\nWhen you approach your local station,\nit should not be just to throw rocks. The\nimpersonal “station” will turn into a person\n—a man who is more easily caught with\nhoney than with vinegar. So hand out orch¬\nids for the programs you believe are ex¬\ncellent. Then suggest that all the community\ngroups whom you are representing can and\nwill put their full weight behind more such\nprograms.\nBe ywarned .by radio. Before the public\nfinally rose against the worst aspects of\nchildren’s radio programs, the program pat¬\ntern was already set. In the face of apparent\nsuccess with objectionable programs, the\ncombined efforts of all the dissatisfied par¬\nents, teachers, ministers, and civic groups\ncouldn’t cancel the evils of over-exciting\nserials. They could only now and then\nsupplement the bad with better programs,\nwhich often failed to appeal to children\njaded by strong fare.\nStation managers are always sensitive to\nthe voice of the public. Their operation in¬\ncome depends on the number of sets tuned to\ntheir call letters. So your proposals must\nbe backed by strong, organized community\npressure. You are dealing with individuals\nwho are your own good neighbors, with the\nsame concern for the community that you\nhave. If you can show them they won’t lose\naudience and money on the kind of programs\nyou want, you’re in.\nNOTE: What is said here about children’s\nprograms is true of all programs, and of\nradio as well as television.\nTea, Preparations, Institute\nTEA\nRepresentatives of many organizations\ndrank tea with Mrs. W. A. Lucht, President\nof the Illinois Council on Motion Pictures,\nRadio, Television, and Publications, and\nplanned the Fall Workshop. Mrs. Mead\nMessick, chairman of Radio-TV Committee,\nwill conduct the workshop on the Look-\nListen Project. Last year, under her chair¬\nmanship in AAUW, 750 members of the\nIllinois AAUW participated in the Project.\nPROJECT PREPARATIONS\nThe California State Division of AAUW\nhas already ordered material for the Look-\nListen Project, and is ready to distribute\nit this month. For three years it has been\na valuable part of the Look-Listen Project,\nand for many years has been working for\nbetter radio-TV programs.\nINSTITUTE, OCT. 22, MADISON\nYou are invited to the Wisconsin Better\nRadio-TV Institute in Great Hall of the\nUniversity Union, Oct. 22. It will consider\nthe Evaluation of Radio-TV Drama, Mak¬\ning Your Opinions Felt, and Educational\nTelevision. Dean Kenneth Bartlett of Syra¬\ncuse University will be the main speaker.\nThe Institute aims to help youth and\nadults to work together for better programs.\nLast year one third of the audience were\nhigh school students.\nNews Items\nThe American Research Bureau now\nrecords not only the number of sets tuned\nto a certain television program, but also the\nnumber of people watching it. According\nto ARB findings, about the same number of\nsets were tuned to “Mr. Peepers” and “Mar¬\ntin Kane.” But “Mr. Peepers” had four\nand a half million more viewers.\n“Omnibus” is reported to be putting on\na ninety minute version of “King Lear” this\nfall, with Petter Brook, one of England’s\ntop Shakespearean directors, staging it.\n“World-Wide Playhouse” will show\nUnited Nations activity in dramatic form.\nThe aggregate income of radio stations in\nareas served by television increased 2% in\n1952 over 1951, according to FCC figures.\nItalian movie stars, such as Anna Magnani\nand Vittorio Gassman, will be seen on\nAmerican television this winter, with Eng¬\nlish dubbings.\nBritain has decided to accept advertising\non its TV programs, but not sponsors. In\nother words the BBC will still be responsible\nfor the programming. The British make this\ncomparison: “The press accepts ads, but\nthey remain responsible for their own news\nand editorial columns.”\nMaurice Evans is planning a two-hour\nversion of Macbeth, probably to be soon on\nthe Hallmark Hall of Fame.\nThe Next Newsletter\nThe next “newsletter” will include:\nAn Introduction to ACBB Officers\nThe Seven Criteria of Franklin Dunham,\nChief of Radio-TV, U. S. Office of Edu¬\ncation.\nNews of Good Radio Programs\nNews of Ways of Getting Good Programs\n(Please contribute to this department)\nMany other short articles.\nListen, This Month, to:\nNew York Philharmonic Sun., 2:30 p.m.\nCBS.\nNBC Symphony, Sat., 6:30, NBC\nChicago Symphony, Wed., 8:30 MBS.\nWould it be a good idea for members of\nthe Council to ask members of their organ¬\nizations to notice how many times in the\ncoming month they listen to these programs,\nand hand in their score at the next meet¬\ning? “Newsletter” would be interested in\nyour reaction to this question; also to your\nscore sheet, if you make one.\nWill Stress Mass\nCommunications\nScholastic Teacher, 33 W. 42nd St., New\nYork 36, N.Y., is running a column, “We\nTried This.” The editor, W. D. Boutwell,\nwould like to have short reports on how\nJunior and Senior High School teachers in\nclass discussion helped students evaluate\nout-of-school radio-TV programs. He is\nespecially interested in evidence of pro¬\njects along the line of comparative analysis\nof news commentators. If you know of such\nprojects, will you write to him.\nIn the same magazine Nancy Faulkner\nedits a column on radio and television. The\nSeptember and November issues will carry\nnews of this Council.\nBuy the Advertising that\nPleases You\nWhen you buy, you are influenced chief¬\nly by the quality of the article, and by how\nmuch you get for your money. In these,\nrespects competing products are often ap¬\nproximately the same. When they are, do\nyou buy products advertised in ways you\nlike—that is, by excellent programs with\nacceptable advertising? You buy a certain\ntype of advertising when you buy. Do you\nencourage the kind of commercial that in¬\ncites Junior to tease Mom to rush to the\nstore and buy XYZ? Let your dollar follow\nyour taste.\nOne thing more—TELL the merchant that\nyou have bought the product because of\nthe quality, plus the good program, plus\nthe good advertising.\nOne Joins\nONE JOINS ACBB for two reasons:\n1. he knows that those who want pro¬\ngrams of quality need to unite on a national\nbasis.\n2. he believes citizens should make a\nlittle effort to STUDY the quality of pro¬\ngrams and EXPRESS their opinions ef¬\nfectively and with force of numbers.\nMEMBERS RECEIVE the “Better Broad¬\ncasts News Letter,” which can serve as a\nNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF IDEAS and\nwill give NEWS which is difficult to find\nin current papers and magazines. As mem¬\nbership grows, it will probably be issued\nmonthly except in the summer. Three issues\nare guaranteed this first year, with more\na possibility.\nFor individual membership, send one dol¬\nlar ($1.00) to Mrs. C. B. Chambers, 3480-\n7th St., North, St. Petersburg, Florida.\nThis month is MEMBERSHIP MONTH.\nPlease use this newsletter not merely to join,\nyourself, but to interest others. PLEASE\nACT NOW."
