BROADCASTS .NEWS LETTER\nTHREE\nINDICATOR OF OPINION\nOne method of alerting thought about\nradio-TV programs, preparatory to the\nLook-Listen Project, is being tried by the\nWisconsin Association for Better Radio and\nTelevision—the Indicator of Opinion.\nWe reprint it for those who wish to use\nit. Copies of it may be made for use in\ngroups. In sending results to ACBB Head¬\nquarters, 423 N. Pinckney, Madison, Wis.,\nplease send in the number of Yeses and\nNoes for each question—not merely the re¬\nport of the majority vote. And please send\nin a report if your group uses the Indicator,\nwon’t you?\nThe PURPOSE of the Indicator is to\ngive listeners a few interesting and definite\npoints to consider before taking part in the\nLook-Listen Project (that Project being our\nimportant undertaking); also to inform\nbroadcasters and sponsors of these opin¬\nions.\nA. NEWS\n1. Do you know what preparation news\ncommentators have for weighing the im¬\nportance of news? For instance:\nHas your favorite commentator, .,\na) a college education? Yes.... No....\nb) extensive foreign travel? Yes.... No....\nc) experience on a newspaper noted for\ngiving both sides of questions? Yes.... No....\n2.

Time.\n3. a) Do you ask yourself, when a\nnewsman presents one side of a question,\nwhether there is another side? Yes....No.\nb) In the last month, have you sought\nthe other side by:\n1. listening to a commentator who is\nimpartial or who has a different slant?\nYes.... No.....\n2. reading a newspaper or magazine\nwith a different slant? Yes.... No.—\nB. PLAYS\n1. a) Do dramas of family life have\nalways to be funny to be entertaining?\nYes....

Should violence or the threat of vio¬\nlence be the only (or even the main) ele¬\nment of interest in a play for children?\nYes.... No. Or for adults? Yes.... No.\n3. Do most broadcast plays you hear\nreveal greatness of spirit in the hero? Yes....\nNo. Or merely his getting what he\nwants for himself (girl, money, position)?\nYes.... No.\nC. CHOICE OF TOPIC:\nIf you could get programs on these sub¬\njects, to which would you listen? Please\ncheck:\n1. Other countries —\n2. Books ....\n3. Child study ....\n4. Travel —\n5. Science _\n6.

Within the month have you listened\nto programs intended for children: often ....;\nthree times or more ....; once not at\nall .\nProgram Trends, 1954-55\nIn television the trend is toward longer\nprograms, the expense being met by alter¬\nnating or multiple sponsorship. ABC al¬\nready has scheduled four hour-long dramas.\nCenter Stage, which alternated with U.S.\nSteel Hour this summer, changes its name\nto Elgin Hour—but not its quality, Tues¬\nday, 9:30-10:30 p.m. EST. Kraft Theater\nwijll appear Wed. 9:00 p.m. on NBC;\nThursday, 9:30 p.m. on ABC. Lux Theater\nwill be seen Thursday at 10:00 p.m. on NBC.\nDisneyland, ABC, 7:30-8:30 p.m. Wednes¬\ndays, is a full hour show.\nThe advantages of the ninety-minute\npresentation have been demonstrated by\n“Omnibus,” a very popular program last\nyear. It returns to CBS-TV, Sunday, Octo¬\nber 17.\nNBC will feature several “spectaculars’,\nmost of them ninety minutes long. The first\nof these is a two-hour presentation of “Mac¬\nbeth” with Maurice Evans, sponsored by\nHallmark. With this emphasis on big shows,\nnetworks are vying with each other for well\nknown artists and producers.\nFirestone, 7:30 Mondays on ABC;\nLOOK AND LISTEN\nLook and listen and tell what you think.\nIt’s simple, effective. It is the method of the\nLook-Listen Project, the one undertaking\nof this year in which all groups cooperating\nin the American Council for Better Broad¬\ncasts will urge their members to take part.\nEach person is asked to listen to eight\nprograms on one network between 3-10\np.m. and check them as good, excellent,\nmediocre, or poor, and tell why they\nchecked as they did. The overall report,\nsummarizing all these individual reports is\nsent to broadcasters, sponsors, and the Fed¬\neral Communications Commission which\nlicenses stations. Because sponsors and\nbroadcasters are asking themselves (in\nearly spring especially) what changes to\nmake in programs, it is necessary to get in¬\ndividual reports to Headquarters by JAN¬\nUARY 31.\nMany, many reports are necessary for\nmaximum \"eflecl of the Piujecl. Those con¬\ntrolling programs would like to know, if\npossible, what everybody thinks of their\nprograms. The nearer the Project comes to\nbeing a total report, the more influential it\nis.\nThe Project is also helpful to those who\nreport. One needs to know what he wants\nif he is to get it. One can’t think what it is\nhe likes and does not like about a program\nwithout becoming more sure what it is that\nhe wants.\nThis project is not like the surveys of\ncommercial rating bureaus; for it emphasizes\nopinions of programs. It is complementary to\nthem.\nIt is the chance for people to attend to\ntheir business. The air waves belong to the\npeople. They are responsible for expressing\nthemselves on what is being done with them.\nThe first step in taking part in the project\nis to get supplies. They are sent without\ncost except the cards, which are three cents\nper person. However, you belong to some\nlocal group which would probably want to\nhave a part in helping this project. If it\nand ten of its members join ACBB, cards\nfor as many as thirty participants will be\nsent without charge. Dues are nominal; so\nthis should not be difficult. Each member\ngets five copies a year of the Newsletter.\nSend for material to Mrs. G. F. Matthews,\n4539 Winnequah Road, Madison, Wis., in\nplenty of time so that you will have every¬\nthing by early January, or before.\nINFORMATION FOR TEACHERS\nA special 24-page section of Scholastic\nTeacher for October 6 will be devoted to\nnew TV and radio programs having some\nmerit for schools.\n“Listenables and Lookables” is now be¬\ncoming a regular weekly service in all teach¬\ner editions of Scholastic Magazines.\nFor NEWS and GETTING ACQUAINT¬\nED WITH PEOPLE, PLACES, AND\nTHINGS, Edward R. Murrow is back on\nCBS with “See It Now” Tuesday at 10:30\nand “Person to Person” Friday at 10:30;\nand will have a program for young people\nin the manner of “Person to Person.” It will\nconsist of interviews of young people and\nwill be called “Youngsters.”\nSunday afternoon is especially strong in\nprograms of general information on most\nof the networks.\nMUSIC is all but absent from television."
