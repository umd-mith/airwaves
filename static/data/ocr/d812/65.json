Representatives from 18 na¬\ntional organizations, 18 state groups, and\nmany local organizations attended the or¬\nganizational meetings. Delegates were there\nfrom 93 cities in 34 states.\nThey formed the AMERICAN COUN¬\nCIL FOR BETTER BROADCASTS, a non¬\nprofit, coordinating organization, to corre¬\nlate the efforts of scattered groups and indi¬\nviduals for better radio-TV programming.\nThe PURPOSE is to stimulate the broad¬\ncasting of good radio and television pro¬\ngrams; to study, in order to arrive at stand¬\nards for judging programs; and to encourage\nall radio and television stations in fulfilling\ntheir obligations to ‘‘serve the public in¬\nterest, convenience and necessity.”\nFor nation-wide impact, the Council\nagrees to unite on one nation-wide project,\neach year. The 1953-54 project is the\nLOOK LISTEN PROJECT. It asks groups\nto enlist as many members as possible (and\nothers) to rate 8 network programs (3-10\nP.M.) on one radio or television station,\nand tell why they rated the programs as\nthey did. The reports need to be in by Jan¬\nuary 31, if they are to be included in the\n1954 report that goes to sponsors, broad¬\ncasters, and the Federal Communications\nCommission.\nWRITE TO MRS. G. F.

State .\nChildren’s Television\nChildren have strong tastes for programs\nadults consider not good for them. The\nBritish Broadcasting Company believes this\ndemand should be partially met. But, ac¬\ncording to the Educational Supplement of\nthe London Times, it keeps in mind the\n‘‘solitary viewer’s vulnerability to fear. Bad\nmen are allowed to be really bad, and the\nchild has the satisfaction of seeing the good\nones treat them as they deserve. Neverthe¬\nless it is careful not to restrict its work to\nany over-tight theories about audience’s\npreferences. It tries to give abundant\ndiversity.”\nA few of its entertainment programs have\nsecondary educational benefits. “Through\nplays it may try to awaken curiosity about\npainting or history; other programmes—a\nstory begun and left in the air, or imaginary\nconversation with dead authors—are planned\nas an incitement to reading; others coax the\naudience to watch birds or to use their\nhands.”\nPeople Seem Pleased\nPeople have expressed gratification.\nMrs. Gertrude Broderick, President of the\nAssociation for Education by Radio-TV,\nsays: “You are to be congratulated on the\nfine progress you have made in such a\nshort time, and I have every confidence that\nthis newest effort will bear fruit a thousand¬\nfold.”\nWilliam D. Boutwell, Editor of Scholastic\nTeacher, “I am very pleased to know you\nare making such progress with the Council\nfor Better Broadcasts.”\nNorman Cousins, Editor, Saturday Re¬\nview of Literature, “I am delighted to learn\nof your new Coordinating Council. It is\ntremendously heartening to see the increased\neffectiveness of your work and to observe\nthe actual evidence of your growth.”\nFranklin Dunham, Chief of Radio-TV,\nU. S. Office of Education, “More Power to\nyou.”\nArthur J. Freund, Chairman of Section\non Criminal Law, American Bar Ass’n,\n“You are engaged in a most worthy and\nhighly necessary endeavor. I want to as¬\nsure you of my deep personal interest and\nconcern.”\nCharles A. Siepmann, Chairman, Commu¬\nnications Dep’t, New York University, “I’m\ndelighted that your organization goes so\nwell.”\nRalph Steetle, Executive Director, Joint\nCommittee on Educational Television, “It\nseems to me that the American Council has\na challenging assignment before it.”\nNOTES ON MAGAZINES\nThe first issue this fall of Parent-Teacher\nMagazine carries an account of the forming\nof the Council for Better Broadcasts in the\ncolumn, \"What’s Happening in Education.”\nThe Journal of the Association for Edu-\ncation-TV tells the story of the Council’s\norganizational meetings and its objectives.\nResponse to \"Variety\"\nIn response to its article about the ACBB\norganizational meetings in Minneapolis,\nVariety received a letter from Shigeru Nak¬\namura, Director of the Radio Culture Re¬\nsearch Institute of Japan.
