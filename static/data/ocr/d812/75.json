Bird, Exec¬\nutive Secretary, NSSC, Stephens\nCollege, Columbia, Missouri.\nCommittees Need Help\nI would like to hear from the\nmembership on specific projects\neach of you think should occupy the\nattention of one or more study and\nresearch committees. If you have\naccess to methods, personnel, data,\nareas that might be valuable in car¬\nrying on a particular project, let me\nknow.\nSome of the specific suggestions\nfor study and research which have\nbeen made are: (1) A study of jar¬\ngon; (2) A study of the effect of\nstress upon words; (3) A study of\nthe direction of meaning; (4) A\nstudy of the irresponsible use of\nlanguage; and (5) A study of the\nmis-use of language in important\nCongressional hearings. What do\nyou think of these suggestions?\n—Joe Baccus\nWe Are too Academic!\nIt has been brought to my atten¬\ntion that the tenor of our publica¬\ntions is primarily academic, and\naddressed mostly to members of the\nacademic profession. While this is\ntrue, it is not what was intended by\nthose who organized the Society.\nOne of the principal reasons why\nI joined NSSC in its first year was\nthe hope that the new organization\ncould go beyond the capabilities oF\nany one group, and do something\nuseful by combining the capabilities\nof communication-minded people\nfrom all the academic disciplines\nwith those of similar people in busi¬\nness and industry and government.\nHowever, NSSC was sparked at\nfirst, and for the most part is still\nsparked, by teachers or former\nteachers. This may explain the tenor\nof our publications, but it also con¬\nfesses that as yet we have not suc¬\nceeded in establishing an enterprise\nwhich utilizes the forces of a full\npartnership of people from many\nprofessions.\nEffective communication is a con¬\ncern of all leaders, and the study of\ncommunication is an exercise re¬\nquisite to success in any leadership\nPage 2\nfunction, such as being a good par¬\nent, or a good teacher, or a good ad¬\nministrator or executive. NSSC can\ndo its best work by coordinating the\nefforts of capable persons in all lines\nof endeavor.\nOur editors, however, can publish\nonly what is submitted. Only as our\nnon-teacher members come through\nwith something to print can the\ntenor of our publications be modi¬\nfied. Our editors do in fact bend\nover backward to publish every¬\nthing that is submitted by repre¬\nsentatives of business or govern¬\nment. —Burt Byers\nChapters Have Value\n(Editor’s Note: When the Portland\nChapter was re-organized in Febru¬\nary, nine members addressed a letter\nto interested persons setting forth\nclearly and aptly the purpose and\nvalue of the local chapter and its rela¬\ntionship to NSSC. I am quoting from\nthat letter, hoping that the ideas may\nbe helpful to members of other local\nchapters and to persons considering\nthe organization of new chapters.)\n“The purpose of a local chapter\nshould be to bring together people\nfrom various walks of life who are\ninterested in and working on the\nproblems of communication, people\nwho, in addition, recognize the spe¬\ncial value for such ends of a national\ngroup which sponsors study and\nactivity in all parts of the nation\nand in various groups whose policies\nand principles influence the course\nour culture takes in its growth.”\n“The chief value of a local chapter,\naside from furnishing a channel of\ncommunication with the national or¬\nganization, would be that through\nit the members would be kept sys¬\ntematically informed of the insights\nand developments among our local\nmembers as to the nature and prob¬\nlems of human intercommunication\nprocesses. But that is not all. At\nleast two or three other values ought\nto be listed: the opportunity to ex¬\nplore the importance of the insights\nand developments in our field of\ninterest for each other, our families,\nour community, and our enterprises;\nthe opportunity, also, for members\nto explain their own methods of us¬\ning communication in personal and/\nor group relations—and to receive\nconstructive criticism of those meth¬\nods; and the satisfaction, ultimately,\nof making a contribution at the\ngrass-roots toward the improvement\nof human life by the influence of\nour chapter upon the growth of in¬\ndividuals.”\nCommittee Reports\nColleges and Universities\nImmediate objectives of the com¬\nmittee are: (1) To determine the\ncurricular structure of a course in\ncommunications; (2) To submit the\ncourse to NSSS members for exami¬\nnation and refinement; (3) To pub¬\nlish the results in the form of a\nsyllabus; (5) To submit the syllabus\nto educators for possible use; (6) To\nseek to bring institutions, course\nand teachers together; and (7) To\nstress experimentation in summer\nsession activities.\n—Granville Basye\nElementary Education\nThe specific tasks which we shall\ntackle this year are: (1) Develop¬\nment of basic principles upon which\nto build communication programs\nfor elementary schools; (2) Devel¬\nopment of specific objectives for\nsuch programs; and (3) Evaluation\nof existing programs.\nCommittee members are Mrs.\nDorothy Miller and Frank Roberts.\n—Delpha Hurlburt\nFamily and Community\nTwo projects for the current year\nare: (1) A study of recent attacks\non public education in relation to\nparent-child, family-c o m m u n i t y\ncommunication; and (2) An explor¬\nation of language and non-language\nsymbols of the marriage relation¬\nship as these symbols relate to the\nproblem of an excessive divorce rate.\nTheodore Johannis is a new mem¬\nber of the committee.\n—Elwood Murray\nMass Media\nCommittee objectives are as fol¬\nlows: (1) To collect information and\ndata about mass communication and\nmake it available to interested per¬\nsons through the publications, con¬\nventions and other facilities of the\nsociety; (2) To provide concrete\nguidance and assistance to persons\nworking on problems in mass com¬\nmunication.\n(3) To develop programs in mass\ncommunication at the meetings and\nconventions of not only the society\nbut of other interested organizations\nas well; (4) To identify existing\nproblems in mass communication\nand find the appropriate agencies\nor individuals to seek solutions; and\n(Continued on page 10)\nThe NSSC Newsletter"
