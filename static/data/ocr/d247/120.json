Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harolds\nThanks for the recent memo concerning travel\ninsurance. I was present at the time of the last\ngo*around on this and was in favor then. I still\nwould hop© we could proceed to put the major NAE3\nHeadquarters staff on the policy. It looks like\nthe only problem is one of budget, and this will\ndictate how much we can do. Will this matter have\nto wait until the next Board Meeting at Detroit,\nor can anything be done in the meantime?\nSincerely,\nof Television\nand KUON-TV\nMcferide\nJMoBs ss\ncc: Mr. William Harley"
