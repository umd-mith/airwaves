Apparently BUI Harley was in town and talked\nthis over. Wish I had been involved. I note in the\nnlaates of the executive committee some reference to\nthia natter but I euspect nore was said. Can you brief\nne fully, Fron where Z git, and I admit to naivete\nas a newcomer^ to your board, any friction between\nNM8 and BFA would seen most unwise* They are trying\nto do an important job and there isoertalnly plenty\nof work in this area. As for Si, he is one of the most\ndynamic and effective men in our craft and this we need\ntoo. At this point 1 an Just confused and in need of\nnuoh nore briefing fron you, Hope you will have tine\nto tell ne both sidesof this story.\nOn the personal side, META continues to rook\nsomewhat like a drunken sailor. It always seens\nto stay on its feet but it is often very wobbly, Unless\nit becomes a stronger force in New York City, there will\nbe little I can do there except bite my nails and get\nfrustrated. So X an on the look for other possible\nopportunities, I should hgve ny Master’s degree wrapped\nup in June • Now I shall become dangerous as are all those\nwith Just a little knowledge in a new field for then. But\nX an huable too and think I could fit in at a post like\nMhenkkea has or as a manager of an 1TV station, etc. In,\nthe hope that you nay be able to promote ne a little I an\nlending under separate cover sons resumes, I have made\nplenty so don’t spare then. Naturally I shall appreelata\nanything you might be able to do. Anyhow, advise me, if\nyou have some thoughts.\nMy best to all there.\nSincerely,\n6ru <*\nJLJt\nE A Bungerford Jr"
