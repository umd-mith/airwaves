Harley\nPresident\nNAEB\nWHA-TV\nMadison, Wisconsin\nDear Bill:\nThe more I think about it the more I am convinced that we could well\ndo away with the NAEB Journal entirely. This ineffective monster has\nbecome an albatross and will ever be a financial liability.\nWhy couldn't we expand the Newsletter and include within that publi¬\ncation what desirable features there are now in the Journal? This\nthought is submitted for your consideration.\nWith kindest regards, I am\nSincerely yours\nRDH/ml\nRaymond D. Hurlbert\nDirector Region 11\ncc: Dr. Harry Skornia"
