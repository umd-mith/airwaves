Kellogg Foundation\n250 Champion Street\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Maurice:\nFor various reasons, including principally liaison with other educational\ngroups based there, and with various governmental and other agencies,\nthe NAEB Board is discussing JLn a preliminary way the desirability and/or\npossibility of moving our Headquarters to Washington.\nI felt that the first thing to do was raise this question with you, to see\nhow this would or might affect our grant from you, if it occurred while\nthis was still in effect.\nI realize that you may not be able to give an off-the-cuff reply. In case\na meeting with you would be desirable. Bill Harley or I, or both, would\nbe glad to visit you to discuss this with you sometime early this fall.\nOr, if necessary or desirable, we might be able to discuss when we*re\nall in Washington in early September.\nWe*d be glad to have your reaction. And all best wishes.\nSincerely,\nhjs:rs\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director"
