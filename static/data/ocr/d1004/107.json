A. van Hijk\nMarch 10, 1958\nPage 2\nevaluate the role and effectiveness of correspondence study\nas a feedback method in instruction by television at the\nUniversity level, this was discussed at the last meeting\nof the group but 1 am sure that no action on it has yet\nbeen taken. You might write to the chairman of this division\nof the NUEA. He is Lloyd F. Hansen, Director, Correspondence\nStudy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 14, Minnesota.\nI am certain that no adequately controlled studies of\nthis sort of teaching have been done in this country. There\nwould, therefore, seem to me to be little value in paying\nsomeone to try to collect data from such studies. Z would\nthink that the American Council on Education and Hansen of\nthe NUEA would be able to supply practically all of the avail¬\nable information which is not Included in the reports 1 have\nnoted from other places.\nX hope that you will find the above information of at\nleast some help. If there is anything else that the NAEB\ncan do, please feel free to write to me.\nSincerely,\nSLB:mw\nSam L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radlo-Fllm"
