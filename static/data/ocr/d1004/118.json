It will not only provide even stronger representation\nfor individual television members but will serve as an action\nchannel for such people as the LTV station managers. I will\nsoon writ© each LTV station manager, informing him of this\nchannel.\nI would appreciate your keeping me informed in a general way\nof your Committee activities as new ideas are developed in¬\nvolving your Committee, I will be in touch with you. Feel free\nto correspond if I can help In any way* Also, at this time\nlet me invite each Committee Chairman to forward any ideas he\nmight have on TV services and actions needed -- not necessarily\nrestricted to his committees area, but as regards the entire\nNAEB television obligation.\nI look forward to working with you in the coming year.\nSine ©rely.\nVice President\nJs©\nDictated by Mr. McBride\nsigned in his absence"
