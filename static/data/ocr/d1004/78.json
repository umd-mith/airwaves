Cheydleur\nAssistant Director\nFlorida University Broadcasting Services\nGainesville, Florida\nDear Raymond:\nI’m still partly under from the pace of the N.A.E.B. Research\nSeminar, but am beginning to recuperate* At short range, the meeting\nappears to have been highly successful* At long range, it should\nprove to be even more successful,\nI am enclosing a brief statement of NPAC interest in an inventory-\ndigest of radio research. You may recall that this matter came up toward\nthe close of the sessions, I hope that this statement will be a reminder\nand that it will help identify people who might be interested in a venture\nof this kind. From this beginning, it should be possible to fill in de¬\ntails and develop a plan to produce a document that will be useful to the\nmany people concerned with radio broadcasting.\nI should appreciate having your reactions to the approach suggested\nand would be glad to supply additional explanations and details. In\naddition, could you suggest interested and capable people who might be\napproached on this matter?\nThis inquiry and enclosure are going to all the Seminar participants\nin the hope that we can make an early start in this area.\nWith best wishes for Christmas and the New Year,\nSincerely yours.\nJohn M. Parsey\nResearch Director\nJMP: ts\nEnclosures"
