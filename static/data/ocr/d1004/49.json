Has he joined our committee?\nI did not see his name on one of the flyers you sent out to us a couple of\nweeks ago.\nBy the way, although Paulu and Harry S. never mentioned a date as to when\nKeith was to finish editing the Columbus material, I*m just wondering that if\nit is to be of any help if it shouldn*t be wound up by early spring.\nThere* s nothing else at the moment. I did send rry grants-in-aid report back\nto Ken, However, —the day after it arrived.\nCordially,\nRaymond D. Cheydleur\nAssistant Director"
