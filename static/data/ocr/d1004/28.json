  "text": "January 16, 1958\nMr. Kenneth Harwood, Chairman\nTelecommunications\nUniversity of Southern California\nUniversity Park\nLos Angeles, California\nDear Ken:\nI ms extremely disappointed in the quality of the applicants\nfor research grants in aid. In ray opinion, the only one really\ndeserving of aid is the applicant from Washington. Sven here, 1 am\nnot sure that this is being done in the best possible way. 1 would\ncertainly place him first, however, and give him the entire $500.00\nwhich he requested. The hypothesis to be tested by this study is\ncertainly the most meaningful of any in these applications.\nX would place the Minnesota application second. X hesitate to\ndo this for two reasons: (1) X don't believe that this study is of\nmuch general value to educational broadcasting (though more so than\nmost of these proposed) and (2) X fear that some MASS members may\nfeel that bias was operating due to the fact that Faulu is president\nof the organization. Nonetheless, the rationale, the procedures,\netc. have been much better thought out in this proposal than in most\nof the others and this deserves consideration. I would not give him\nthe full $500. Xt seems to me that his staff could do much of the\nwork — as most stations do in such studies. X would not go more\nthan $300.00 for postage and supplies and some clerical help. This\n$300.00, however, should be on the condition that the study be done\nas proposed.\nBecause of the quality of most of these proposals, X would place\nEd Browne's request third — his request for $100.00 to help defray\nthe expenses of his completed study.\nX am somewhat tempted to eay that X would go no further than\nthis, that none of the others are worth contributing to at all. X\nam not sure that this is wise, however, if we are trying to build a\nresearch interest and function into the NAEB."
