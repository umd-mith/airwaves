C.\nDear Mrs. fyert\nHere is our reaction to the Draft of Brochure No. 4, Audio-Visual Service\nin Colleges and Universities.\nFirst of all, a couple of passing details. On page 31, should the words\n\"monitoring speakers\" be added in the tenth from the last line, after\n\"PA systems?\"\nTwo lines lower, and in the middle of page 33, could our address ignore\n\"University of Illinois.\" please, and give instead the address as 14\nGregory Hall? Sorry we’re still using stationery Miles got, or this\nwould be changed.\nI wonder if you might like to try diagrams of Organizational charts\n(p. 16). We found this useful in several of our publications.\nFor the meat of the criticism here, however, which was bound to be some¬\nwhat technical, I asked Cecil Bidlack our TV Engineer, to comment.\nAll the real suggestions, therefore are from him (by way of credit as\nwell as by way of explanation of qualifications of the critic)* Here\nare Cec's principal pointsi\n\"In covering this material obviously only the salient points can be\ncovered* I believe that someplace in the brochure mention should be made\nof the fact that in establishing a radio or television studio, expert\nadvice is needed.\n\"In the suggested equipment lists given in Appendix D, estimated oosts of\ntape recorders is given as IlliO which will buy only the minimum. I\nwould suggest that machines of better quality be purchased inasmuch as\nthey will no doubt have hard usage by a number of inexperienced people.\nHence a better quality machine should provide a longer service and better\ntape quality."
