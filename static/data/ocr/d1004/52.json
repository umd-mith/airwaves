The internal organization necessary to smooth, efficient exe¬\ncution of this task must be worked out and continuously evaluated. Harmonious\ndaily relationships within the audio-visual center must be maintained.\n\"While the director must feel the responsibility for effective and effi¬\ncient administration of the center, he must realize that his staff, his\ncolleagues, and administrative officers of the college must have a part in\ndetermining the centerTs policies and procedures. Students and appropriate\nmembers of the college community should have their part, too. An audio-visual\ncommittee often participates in policy formation. The greatest service can\nbe realized only when the audio-visual service operates with an atmosphere\nof cooperation and co-responsibility which promotes the desire to use the\nmaterials and equipment, to think creatively, to contribute ideas, to experi¬\nment, to question thoughtfully, and to criticize constructively."
