BOWDEN\nAssociate Director\nMr, Sam Becker\nTelevision Center\nState University of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam:\nThe National Association of Educational Broadcasters is\ncurrently engaged in a survey of considerable significance\nto educators throughout the United States. In cooperation\nwith the U.S. Office of Education, the NAEB is surveying and\ndocumenting the ways in which television is being used and\nwill be used in the future as an instrument of education.\nThe project is described more fully in the enclosed NAEB\nstatement.\nThe field work in the survey has been assigned to a\ngroup of Regional Consultants, including myself. My area\nis comprised of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Michigan as well\nas Wisconsin.\nIdeally, I should like to visit each institution or\norganization which is active (or planning to be) in ETV.\nHowever, such an extensive schedule of visits will not be\npossible in the relatively few weeks in which the work must\nbe completed.\nSouthern Regional Education Board\nR. EDWIN BROWNE\nDirector, Broadcasting Services\nUniversity of Kansas\nRICHARD S. BURDICK\nDirector, Metropolitan Philadelphia\nEducational Radio and TV Corp.\nTherefore, and with some reluctance, I*ve resorted to a\nquestionnaire, a copy of which is enclosed. Your response to\nthe questionnaire, describing your present and contemplated\nETV activities, will help to make this a comprehensive, more\nme aningful survey.\nJOHN C. CRABBE\nManager\nCentral California ETV, Inc.\nKEITH M. ENGAR\nDirector, Radio-Television Service\nUniversity of Utah\nKEITH NIGHBERT\nManager, Station WENH-TV\nUniversity of New Hampshire\nI will also appreciate your guidance and counsel with\nrespect to the possible advantage of a personal visit to\nyour organization, school, or system.\nWe hope to complete this phase of the survey before\nApril 1, so that the information may be used as a basis for\nthe subsequent engineering survey.\nJOHN C.
