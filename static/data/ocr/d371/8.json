  "text": "Mr. Sara L. Becker\n-2-\nFebruary 7, 1961\nWe want to know about universities, colleges, extension\ncorrespondence programs, and state or city school systems,\nas well as ETV stations. Although the survey is directed\nprimarily to a consideration of the need for broadcast channels,\nwe also want to locate places where closed circuit systems may\nbe used for transmission of instructional materials.\nSince this request is being addressed to several NAEB-ers\nin your state, I don't expect anyone to report exhaustively on\nindividual activities (for your own operations, that'll come\nlater.) At this stage, I merely want to know \"who\" is doing\nroughly \"what”, so that I can obtain a profile of present and\nfuture planning in your area.\nWith ease (and a speedy reply) in mind, I've enclosed\na form which you may find to be useful. I'm sure you'll under¬\nstand that I will appreciate the highest priority you can give\nthis request.\nCordially yours,\nRay J. Stanley\nWHA-TV/^adio Hall\nMadisofc/6, Wisconsin\nRJS:cp\nEnclosures"
