My first reaction is negative. I think the idea is a good\none but does not r equire the setting up of a national office or the^hiring\nof a full time national research director. Instead, let me suggest a\nconsulting service with a roster of persons on call who could go to the\nlocalities concerned to help stations.\nMy objection to a full blown research operation takes the following:\na. The returns from such surveys (assuming that wealthy stations and\nstations near Universities need no help) will not aupport a full time\noperation.\nb. The research opportunities which arise from such activity will be\nnegligible since I fear that the setting up of the survey will be on a\nhurry-up basis and will not entail the kind of planning necessary to make\nthe survey much more than a sheer nose-counting procedure.\nc. College and university staff members are not going to fall over\nthemselves to try and get one of these survey jobs. From experience, both\nof us know that simply because the cause is good does not mean any kind\nof research assistance particularly when the nature of the project is preset.\nd. There are not enough persons interested in research who are also\ninterested in broadcasting to make any kind of viable organization a realistic\naccomplishment*\ne. No estimate of cost of s urveys is included in the proposal. My\nfeeling is that most stations are not willing to dish out the money to get\nany decent survey done. If a simple nose-counting procedure is all they\nneed, why not underwrite a simple manual of how-to-do-it and sell this to\nstations?"
