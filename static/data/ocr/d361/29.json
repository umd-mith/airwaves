The art director enters the planning as they\nwork out graphic details.\nAs the preparation conti nues, decisions are made about the locale\nof the science lesson, about the nature of the experiment to be included,\nand the illustrations to be used.\nA \"behind the scenes\" look at a start-stop rehearsal demonstrates\nthe care taken to see that the lesson is clear, logical, and properly pre¬\nsented. This vivid process is the culmination of all the planning, the\nscreening, and the hard work reflected in the materials which supple¬\nment the film.
