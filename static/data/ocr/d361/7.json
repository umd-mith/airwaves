Each\nkit contains a film, supplementary resource material, and this TEACHER'S\nMANUAL, and deals with a particular aspect of television's use in the\nformally-organized instructional routine of the classroom.\nAlthough each kit is self-sufficient and may be used individually,\nthe materials have been designed as a coordinated whole, with each unit\nan extension of the others.
