As you watch the film with the group, remem¬\nber that your viewpoint is assumed to be that of a teacher who I ly familiar\nwith classroom procedures, but inexperienced in the use of instructional\ntelevision.\nBear in mind that the classroom sequences in the films do not\nattempt to mirror the full reality of the classroom = They are telescopic\nversions of what takes place, models foreshortened in time and pace and\nprocess, a selective sequence of high points offered only to SUGGEST\nthe full and complete routines of the classroom.\nPreparation. . . lesson. . .immediate fo I low-through. .. long-range\nfol low-through . . .are not the separate and distinct processes which these\nterms may suggest. They are the merging and interwoven elements of\na total process by which the classroom teacher and al I the other resources\nof the classroom help children learn. These terms are used only for clarity\nin communicating about these elements.\nAs you view this film, keep in mind your reasons for doing so.\nAlso keep in mind any special points or procedures for which you are\nasked to be alert, and what you expect the viewing group to do as a\nresult of the viewing experience.\nA-9"
