Reporter John Fitch talks to Mr. Timothy\nJohnson of M.l .T. about how the system works. Then he talks to\nDr. Larry Roberts about how the system can be used to draw and\nperfect flow-charts.\nLesson Excerpt This four-minute segment of the SCIENCE RE-\nPORTER program on COMPUTER SKETCHPAD\nshows the designer drawing various geometric figures with the\nlight-pen. The computer then indicates, by the image on the\noscilloscope, how the various figures will change as perspective\nis changed or dimension is altered. Given a three-dimensional\nobject, the computer can show how the object will look as seen\nfrom four separate views. Given two three-dimensional objects,\nthe computer can show on the Sketchpad how these objects will\nrelate to each other in various visual perspectives and how they\nwill relate as one passes through and intersects the other."
