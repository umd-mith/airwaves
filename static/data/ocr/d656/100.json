Please\nlet me know by phone immediately (if you have not already returned my\nphone call) what we need him to do.\nThere were a few other items I have to discuss with you when you\nhave a moment. I gather the hearings went off in great style. I’ll\nbe looking forward to receiving the taped coverage.\nPeace!\nLit\nMarjorie Newman\nMN/je"
