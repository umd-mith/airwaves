C.\nDear Congressman Baring:\nI regret that I was unable to see you personally on my recent visit to Washington regard¬\ning the Educational Television Bill which has been introduced in the Senate. However,\nMrs. Dollard was very gracious in taking considerable time with me to discuss both the\nlegislation and the status of the ETV project in Nevada.\nFrom our conversation, I know that your office will give the bill careful study. I know,\ntoo, that you have a tremendous amount of written material to review, but the Carnegie\nCommission Report will be well worth your time for a better understanding of this legis¬\nlation before it reaches the House.\nShould you or your staff have questions regarding the Commission Report or the Senate\nBill, please feel free to call any one of the following at the office of the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB), 1346 Connecticut Avenue N. W.,\ntelephone 667-6000: Mr. William G. Harley, President; Mr. C. Scott Fletcher, Execu¬\ntive Consultant, or Mr. Chalmers H. Marquis, Jr., Executive Director of Educational\nTelevision Stations, a division of the NAEB; and Mr. Jerrold Sandler, Executive Director\nof National Educational Radio, also a division of the NAEB.\nPlease convey my thanks to Mrs. Dollard for the time she took with me. I hope to have\nthe opportunity to meet you personally sometime soon, and I shall look forward to re¬\nceiving your newsletters.\nSincerely\nHELENA. SIDLER (Miss), Coordinator\nResearch and Development\nHAS:eli\nCLARK COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT - TELEPHONE 738-501\n-2832 EAST FLAMINGO ROAD - LAS VEGAS. NEVA"
