Hull\nIn reviewing the minutes of the NAEB Board meeting in Columbus on\nApril 5-6 I find several items on which I am not clear. I would\nappreciate your advice on your understanding of them or supplying me\ninformation where I do not have it.\nItem 1 April 5. Page 2...Motion to re-explore BBC payment of $56.000.\nDoes the simplified motion provide merely for approaching the\nCenter and polling the membership on the 50-50 split, or does\nit additionally provide for re-examination of the basic BBC\ncost requirements and what pound-for-pound or dollar-for-\ndollar NAEB will get for its money as of present negotiations\nrather than past record?\nItem 2 April 6. Page 1...Motion to have Siegel represent NAEB on\ngeneral assembly of UNESCO at his own expense or Hovey in the\nevent Siegel cannot attend.\nWhat, when and where is this general assembly of UNESCO?\nItem 3 April 6. Page 2...Motion to select prestige board of educators\nwith veto power.\nWas the actual intent of the Board to give away its sovereignty?\nItem 4 April 6, Page 2...Motion to appoint Paulu to represent NAEB at\nLondon UNESCO conference. Creshkoff and Hovey to attend as\nalternates or observers at their own expense...other attend¬\ning at approval of President Ausmus.\nI apparently failed to make clear that UNESCO had asked me to\nask the NAEB Board for their opinion only, e. g. NAEB has no\nrights of selection in this area, only those of recommendation.\nHudson and I were requested by the U. S. National Commission\nfor UNESCO to make suggestions on the NAEB and other bases.\nSelection will be made by UNESCO."
