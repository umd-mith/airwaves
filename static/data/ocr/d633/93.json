Such a research\nclearing house function as we were called upon to provide would insure that the\nhuman and financial resources now going into the movement are coordinated\nand reported in clear enough form so they may all be used to best advantage.\nIt would also insure that applicable research in related fields (psychology,\nsociology, learning theory, etc.) is reported, distributed and related to that,\ncarried on specifically for broadcasting needs,\nA copy of the report of this seminar is expected to be available within a\nfew weeks. It will be forwarded at that time.\nIt is particularly in this type of clearing house function for the results\nof experimentation and research in television and radio instructional uses, that\nthe NAEB feels thd: its already existing structure, organization and experience\nmight make it most useful under the National Defense Education Act.\nSo far we have been unable to secure funds to meet the need which we have\nbeen called on to satisfy. This is due, in part, to the reluctance of Foundations\nto supply funds in an area in which .it appears that funds have been specifically\nappropriated by the Congress of the United States."
