VAN DUYN\nNovember 1953\nASSOCIATE DIRECTOR\nMr. Frank Schooley, Treasurer\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana,^Illinois\nDear Frgnk:\nI wanted you to know how much we appreciate the\ncontribution you have made to NAEB. You were particu¬\nlarly gracious in filling the gap after Jim left and\nbefore Skomia was able to take over.\nI realized at the Norman meeting, as I never had\nbefore, that as Treasurer, you also carry a very heavy\nresponsibility and a very important one. Your ability\nto go directly to the heart of a problem and give an\nhonest reaction is always refreshing. I enjoyed being\nwith you all at Norman last week.\nBest wishes.\nSincerely,\nRobert VanDuyn\nRVD/ja"
