With its arrival now seemingly only a matter of days away,\nwe are making many plans not only to adequately use this piece of\nequipment but to change the operation of the network so that it can\nmore speedily and more surely distribute the many fine programs which\nare available to it. The major hope is that we can dispense entirely\nwith the system of legs and start a system of direct distribution to\neach member station. We are also looking forward to handling some\nexceptional program material, especially the Adult Education Projects\nseries.\nThe arrival of the duplicator means not only a change of\nmethods but also a change of personnel and their duties. These\nplans are again well under way. One new member will be added to\nour staff in June and another perhaps in the fall as the details of\nthe operation are developed. The tape duplicator will also solve,\nwe hope, another knotty problem, that of quality reproduction. The\nengineering group is still working on tape reproduction standards\nand is making progress toward the ultimate goal of top quality\nmasters, top quality duplicates, and top quality reproduction by"
