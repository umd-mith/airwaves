But\nthe viewpoints held by considerable numbers of the people on matters currently\nin the arena of public discussion can be expressed on limited radio facilities*\nso that, in essence, all (or nearly all) the people can have freedom to speak\nthrough their informal representatives. It is this freedom of speech that\nmust be safeguarded by the Commission in furtherance of the Bill of Rights*\nX am unalterably opposed, therefore, to giving broadcast licensees\ncomplete freedom to air their special views without the obligation of giving\nequal time and facilities to representatives of differing viewpoints.
