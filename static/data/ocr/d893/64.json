In the same way\nthat the publication of the Blue Book helped to clarify and define \"public\nservice\", the publication of the record in this very hearing and of the per¬\ntinent Congressional discussions 14 years ago will help clarify Congress* intent\nto have licensees present all sides of all issues.\nThe operator of a radio station is human. The operator of a radio sta¬\ntion has ideas about right and wrong; what is good for the local community;\nwhat is good for the state and country. If he is at all interested in progress\nof the station, he or his program director invite others who have similar points\nof view to express them. I have denied right along that any provision in the\nMayflower decision prohibits a broadcaster from doing a public service job in\nhis community. But whether we like it or not, the Mayflower decision has been\nused as an excuse by some stations as the reason for not doing many public\nservice programs.\nAnd yet, a glance at the recent Peabody, Variety and Ohio State Institute\nawards proves that a great many radio stations and networks are broadcasting\nprograms which some would label editorializing. Frankly, I’m not too concerned\nabout the question of whether these programs (which relate to pure water, oppo¬\nsition to racial and religious bigotry and better housing) are editorials or\nnot. Instead of hunting for pet and key words which classify programs into\none category or another, I would much prefer to approach the problem realis¬\ntically and deal with the basic issues involved. The thing which I am con¬\ncerned with is to guarantee the right of those to voice their opinions if they\ndisagree with the views expressed by the station’s owner, news editor or\nvoluntary speaker. As a practical matter, we should waste less time worrying"
