SCHOOLEY\nWILL, University of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nOhio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois\nand Wisconsin.\nDear Dick:\nYou needn*t be ashamed of the current News¬\nletter, It certainly is voluminous. My suggestions are:\n1, Why put on \"December 20\"? It could easily have carried\na December 31st or January 1st date,\n2, Ahe list of important items covered is a very good one,\nexcept how about putting the page number next to it, or di¬\nviding them into certain categories, as you did anyhow? Then\nif you are going to divide them and number the pages accord¬\ningly, as you did on the FCC Commission material, when you\nstart the next categoxy (Commercial Radio Forecast For France)\nthe section ought to be listed; otherwise page two, with\nmembership applications and page three, Mayflower Hearing\nPostponed, doesn*t make sense. I think page two should be\na section by itself so that the members can turn to it with¬\nout having to look over everything else,\n3, How about underlining some of the material like SCHEDUIE\nOF EXPIRATION OF APPLICATIONS or NEW OFFICE OF EDUCATION.\nBOOKLET? That*s stuff they want to see at a glance.\nRegion IV\nCARL MENZER\nWSUI, University of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nIowa, Minnesota, North and South\nDakota, Nebraska and Wyoming.\nBut, by and large, with these minor details, it*s\ntops. I hope you are able to get some help in assembling the\nmaterial and aren*t overworking yourself.\nSincerely,\nRegion V\nRALPH W. STEETLE\nWLSU, Louisiana State\nUniversity\nBaton Rouge, Louisiana\nMissouri, Kansas, Colorado, New\nMexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas\nTexas and Louisiana.\nMr. Richard B.

SENER\nKUSC, University of Southern\nCalifornia\nLos Angeles, California\nMontana, Washington, California,\nIdaho, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona\nand Utah.\nRepresenting\nP.S. By the way, on the Mayflower business box, you missed one\npoint. Shepherd wasn*t just broadcasting the \"frankly editorial\nviews of the owners\" - he was broadcasting the frankly editorial\nand his own highly controversial opinion of candidates at the\nheight of a political campaign, without the other side receiving\ncomparable time. That is a very definite violation and so stated\nowned and operated by colleges, universities, and public-service agencies."
