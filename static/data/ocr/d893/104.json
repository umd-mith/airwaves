As a practical matter, we\nshould waste less time worrying and\ncounseling on the question of whether\nthe program constitutes an editorial\nor a one-side presentation of a con¬\ntroversial issue. Radio stations should\npresent more and more of these pro¬\ngrams.”\nThe former director of New York’s\nmunicipal station recommended also\n“that the Commission set forth\nclear and unequivocal language the\nobligation of licensees to present well\nrounded discussions of all controver¬\nsial issues, as paid of the service to\nthe community.” He termed “a step\nin the right direction,” the new li¬\ncense application form which asks\nspecifically how much time the appli¬\ncant plans to devote to discussions\nof public issues.\nPoints to Lack of Mikes\nTaking broadcasters to task for not\nairing the current hearings, Novik\nsaid that “the wide variety of opin¬\nions expressed here and the free dis¬\ncussion of the problems illustrate the\nbasic solutions of the issues raised\nby the Mayflower decision.” He con¬\ntinued: “Contra-wise, I haven’t heard\nof any one radio station or network\nwhich has placed its microphones be¬\nfore the witnesses and the Commis¬\nsion in this hearing room—as has been\ndone at other non-radio Congres¬\nsional hearings—in order to bring to\nits listeners the different points of\nview expressed here on these basic,\nvital and important issues.”\nMost of MacDonald’s statement con¬\nsisted of an attack on Fulton Lewis,\nJr. MacDonald accused Lewis of step,\nping out of his role as reporter\nengage in lobbying.” He related\na Lewis broadcast last\ncalled upon listeners to wire\nWays and Means Commil\nfrom Page 1)\non a tax matter. A thousand wires\nwere received in response to his\nbroadcast—“many of them obviously\nform communications.”\nMacDonald was closely questioned\nby Louis Caldwell, attorney for WGN,\nwho forced an admission from Mac¬\nDonald that he could not say the ex¬\ntent to which the statement he had\nmade represented the views of the\nNational Farmers Union membership,\nsince the matter had not been the\nsubject of membership decision.\nBarnow, for the Radio Writers\nGuild, said his organization is “aston¬\nished, in view of the democratic vi¬\ntality and freedom of which radio\nhas shown itself capable, when we\nfind a broadcaster demanding that\nradio should be as free as newspa¬\npers.”\nOpposition to removal of the edi¬\ntorial ban came also from the CIO\nspokesman Henry Fleisher, saying he\nfeared radio editorials would usually\nespouse the cause of large corpora¬\ntions, told the Commission that CIO\nhas “watched with amazement and\nsome concern” NAB efforts to break\ndown the ban on editorializing be¬\ncause it seems “superficially at least\nto mark a break with the past. The\nhistory of labor’s relations with radio\nbroadcasters has been dotted with\nclaims from the industry that certain\nsubjects or types of programs—usu¬\nally affecting labor’s presentation of\nviews—are too controversial.”\nClergyman Heard\nRev. Carl Melntire, secretary of\nthe American Council of Christian\nChurches, came out flatly for the\nlifting of the Mayflower ban. He\ncalled for “every possible freedom”\nfor radio, and insisted that the bill\nof rights is not consistent with the\nMayflower decision.\nThe freedom guaranteed to the\npress under the Constitution should\nalsojpe guaranteed to, radio.
