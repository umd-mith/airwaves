Hull\nRadio Station WOI\nIowa State College\nAmes, Iowa\nDear Dick\nI have your letter of January 22.\nI am very happy that the NAEB is going to file a brief\nin and testify at the Mayflower hearing. Certainly edu¬\ncational broadcasters have a great deal to contribute in\nsuch a hearing. I don't know whether you know.it or not,\nbut the President of Cornell University is going to appear\nand testify. I'll be very happy to appear as counsel for\nthe NAEB. You are right that the eleeff* channel matter has\ntaken a good deal of my time but I feel that I should do\neverything within my power not only to help the NAEB sta¬\ntions but to get them to fully utilize their vast poten¬\ntial power for the good of broadcasting and the American\npeople,\nOn the question of the position which the NAEB should take,\nwe are presented with a difficult problem. The President of\nCornell University is taking the position that there should\nbe some kind of modification of the rule. I would assume\nthat there would be some of your members who would be for an\noutright abolition of the rule while others would want to\nmaintain it. How do you propose to solve the problem of\nfiling an official brief on behalf of NAEB, having testimony\npresented on its behalf, and still be sure that you are pre¬\nsenting a concensus of views?\nIncidentally, in your letter you only refer to the brief for\nNAEB and make no reference to the oral testimony. The latter\nis as important, even r * “ m the former."
