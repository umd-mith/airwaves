They\nrange all the way from the heads\nof the 'big networks to represents-\ntives of a dozen individual sta¬\ntions. Practically no small station\noperators are being heard. Chris¬\ntian and Jewish organizations, vet¬\nerans’ outfits, educational institu¬\ntions, political societies — like\nAmerican Civil Liberties union\nand PCA and nearly a score of la¬\nbor unions in radio are speaking\ntheir pieces.\n■yVhen all the testimony is in,\nFederal Communications commis¬\nsioners under Chairman Wayne\nCoy will retire to write their deci¬\nsion. It should be ready long be¬\nfore November elections. If FCC\nreverses present policy and al¬\nlows stations to editorialize, the\nair waves will be opened to the\nmany ‘abuses of partisanshipin\nthe coming election campaigns’.'\nA month ago FCC ruled that ra¬\ndio, stations could not censor and\ncould not be held responsible for\nlibelous matter in political\nspeeches. According to President\nJustin Miller of National Associa¬\ntion of Brordcasters, this ruling\nhas caused “consternation and\nconfusion.” But to give broadcast¬\ners further liberty to take sides\non controversial issues could con¬\nceivably take all the' brakes off\nradio and allow it to run wild.\nThis is apparently what some of\nthe broadcasters want.\nMAYFLOWER CASE\nSETS POLICY\nUnder present Law radio sta¬\ntions are required to operate on\na non-partisan basis. If any sta¬\ntion allows one candidate for po¬\nlitical office time on the air, equal\ntime must be offered opposing\ncandidates.\nSeven years ago FCC/ handed\ndown what has since become\nknown as the Mayflower decision.\nIt contained the policy statement\nthat “Freedom of speech on the\nradio must be broad enough to\nprovide full and equal opportunity\nfor the presentation to the public\nof all sides of public issues.”\nThe case grew out of an appli¬\ncation by Yankee network for re¬\nnewal of license to operate sta¬\ntion WAAB in Boston, owned by\nMayflower Broadcasting corpora¬\ntion. Head of - Yankee was John\nShepard III, who wias deeply in¬\nvolved in Massachusetts politics.\nDuring 1937 and 1938 it was\nWAAB policy to broadcast edito¬\nrials to support the Shepard poli¬\ncies.\nFCC decided this was not oper¬\nating on non-partisan principles.\nWhen the station changed its\nbroadcasts to comply with non-\npartisan principles, its license'\nwas renewed. But the findings in\nthis case have 'been basic radio\npolicy ever since. ,\nThis non-partisan operating pol¬\nicy has been satisfactory to most\nradio stations. It has enabled them\nto keep out of many bitter politi¬\ncal fights. But ftiore prejudiced\nand vogifejous spirits in the busi-\n** ‘ amounts to\nAmes Daily Tribune\nrjgh^ tb.hako sides as newspapers.\nTHE'QUfeSTldN WHY\nIS A PUZZLE\nWhen NAB met at Chicago liast\nfalii the question of editorialising\n-..raised again, Charles R, Den¬\nny/Jrv then FCC chairman, said\nif the industry wanted it, he would\nopen up the subject in general\nhearings. Novr Denny’s hot potato\nis in Coy’s lap.\nWhy broadcasters are so intent\non bringing up the issue at this\ntime is something of a puzzle.\nThere is some belief that it is a\nj smoke screen. The radio industry\nis on Che pan for scheduling too\nm|ny commercials, too many re-\nt rdipgs, too many soap operas\nand too .many child-frighteners. If\nthe radio „ business can put over\nthe idea that it is being censored\nand persceuted by too much gov¬\nernment regulation, it might take\noff some of the heat.\nThat the commission could be\npersuaded to give broadcasters\nless regulation “in the public in¬\nterest” and more freedom of\nspeech seems highly unlikely. Up\nto this (year, it has been the com¬\nmissions’ belief that its policies\nhave ^protected miUority-'groups\nand saved the radio industry from\nmany ‘abuses of unlimited commer¬\ncialism.\nIf these policies should be re¬\nversed,: and radio were allowed\nmore freedom- -of speech, a lot of\n’ things might result.. The radio in¬\ndustry., mightythem. move to get\n| what it reglly wants—freedom\n■from all government regulations,\ni freedom to use any frequency and\ni tany power it chose, freedom to\n! forget all its public service respon¬\nsibilities, freedom 10 spout com¬\nmercials 24 hours a day."
