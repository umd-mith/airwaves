This, however,\nmay he a matter of opinion.\n(9) Perhaps you gentlemen are better contacted than I at Chicago\nand could, suggest aid, comfort, and advice sources from that\ninstitution.\n(10) I will bundle up all of the supplies as soon as I get them\nand turn them over to you.\nI hope shortly to submit for your suggestions and approval, as well as all\nregional committees', a suggested plan of organization, policy, and\nregional and national operation for NAEB.\nI am enclosing a supply of application blanks. Please tell me if you need\nmore. Your idea of mustering up teachers college interest is fine. Please\nfeel free to comment, criticize, or suggest to your full ability, Harold*\nIt is my own feeling that continuity and experience should be passed, along\nin NAEB some way and in a great many ways, you and Mac and WHA represent\nthe fountain head and center of educational operations in this country.\nWhen you have an opportunity, advise me on your plans for the Wisconsin\nInstitute this summer. I plan to come myself and bring several staff members.\nAlso, will both you and Mac give thought to ways and means, not only for a\nsuccessful mid-year NAEB meeting at the Columbus Institute which will get\nus down to brass tacks, but also some way of presenting the NAEB to the\nwhole Institute as the active practioners of America's minority radio.\n(rive me your frank opinion as to whether or not I will be overstepping the\nbounds of modesty and practicality if I ask Tyler for the privilege of\nmaking a personal speech at one of the general sessions—something along the\nline I gave at Chicago, only with specific \"How to Bo It\" items and \"What\nHas Been Bone\" items. *\nx\nBest regards.\nYours sincerely^\n3. 2. Hull\nPresident\nB3H:rmm\nK"
