  "text": "EDITOR1S NOTE\nThis summary has been prepared from notes\ntaken personally at the sessions reported\non. To the best of the editor’s knowledge,\nit represents an accurate condensation of\nthe proceedings. Reporters, however, even\nradio-television reporters, are fallible\n(although it pains us to admit this). In\norder to avoid erroneously attributing\nstatements, names have been deleted from the\nhighly condensed portions dealing with the\ndiscussion periods. It is obviously impos¬\nsible to achieve this in reporting the\nspeeches. The editor begs the indulgence of\nthe speakers where errors have crept in and\nwishes to state that he has followed in spirit\nthe Arab prayer: ”Guard us from error in\nnarration and keep us from folly even in\npleasantry.”\nOne other liberty has been taken: A brief\nsummary of the meeting has been placed,\nnot at the close, but as a Foreword.\nRobert F. Schenkken:\nRecorder"
