Until\nthat happens, I can't predict exactly what those procedures will be. Nor\ncan I promise exactly what dates will be involved, since I do not know the\nfirst crucial date - which is when the Regulations will be published.\nBut, if you will indulge with me in some hypothetical considerations -\nI can try to guess the sequence of events.\n1. Suppose, for instance, that the Regulations were published\nDecember 30. Applicants will be given at least thirty days in which\nto file amendments or new applications for ETV projects. But\nsuppose we allowed 45 days. That would mean a deadline for amend¬\nments and responses from pending applicants of approximately\nFebruary 15.\n2. If that were the case - our staff would require four to six\nweeks to do the initial processing on all such application materials\nfiled prior to the deadline (it goes without saying, that any\nmaterials received after the deadline would have to be deferred to\na later deadline). That would make it approximately April 1, before\nour consultants could review the applications which could be\nconsidered for approval in 1969."
