  "text": "s\nreconciled version enables you to read Title I in sequence, with the\namendments incorporated into the language of the Act,\nA fourth item is the first \"Program Bulletin\" issued by the Educational\nBroadcasting Facilities Program, which contains nine categories of\ninformation relating to the continuing administration of this program.\nIn order to save time, X doa*t propose .to read these to you. But I urge\nyou to read them - and want particularly to direct your attention to these\nitems:\n!>** ^ rather obvious fact that funds available arc for\ntransmission apparatus only - no building, programming or\noperating .costs can be included in a project.\n2) The categories of eligible applicants, as spelled out in the\n. Act. -\n/////\n3) The excerpt from the House report on the subject of 75% grants.\nW© include this for your information to illustrate a problem\nin policy about the handling of \"matching funds\" under this\nprogram. It is an important item of legislative history, and\ntherefore will be a policy factor. Vm not sure everybody\nunderstands what is meant by the Committee’s intent that the\n*75% grant should be the exception rather than the rule.\"\nPolicy on this point has not yet been definitely established.\nBut if you want to discuss it later, we’ll be glad to speculate\nalong with you ."
