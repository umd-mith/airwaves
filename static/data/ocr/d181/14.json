(Program Bulletin #1 carries this implication.)\n2. However, where it may be necessary with respect to a\nproject which is clearly of high priority under foregoing\nrecommendations, limited grant action may be taken coon\nafter the initial cut-off date.\nV. LEGISLATIVE HEEDS IN FY 1970\nFiscal 1970 is the last authorized year of the extended \"Educational\nTelevision Facilities Program.\" Therefore, to plan for continuing\nsupport of educational broadcasting facilities in Fiscal 1971 and\nbeyond will require additional authorization by Congress.\nThe principal advice which seemed to emerge from panel discussion\nof this topic was:\nA. Seek extension of present authorization to cover a five year\nperiod.\n1. Although future technological developments may demonstrate\ndistribution systems other than \"broadcasting\" to be\nessential to provide a full range of telecommunications\nservices to the nation, it appears unlikely that such\nexpansion would either replace existing broadcast stations,\nor diminish the need for their expansion or for activation\nof many more broadcast stations. Thus, the support\nprovided for broadcast facilities by Title I of P.L. 90-129\nshould be extended.\n2. To seek extension for a five-year period (allowing for\nCongressional reduction to a three-year period) would be a\nbetter course than to seek a one-year or two-year extension.\nB. Substantive amendments should not be sought at this time, lest\ndebate over the merits or congressional committee jurisdictions\nimplicit in such amendments obscure the primary objective of\nsecuring extension of existing authorizations."
