THE PUBLIC BROADCASTING ACT\"\nINTRODUCTORY\nBefore we get into the nuts-and-bolts of your Interest in the\nEducational Broadcasting Facilities Program, X should like to have you\nmake the acquaintance of a man Y7hora you should know, and who will have a\nmore than ordinary interest in your participation in this program during\nthe future. He is Dr. John Ludington, Deputy Associate Commissioner of\nthe Bureau in which we find an administrative home - the Bureau of Adult,\nVocational, and Library Programs. >\nIn the somewhat complicated structure from \"Branch\" to \"Division\" to\n\"Bureau\" and on up to the \"Commissioner,\" the business of awarding grant\nfunds for broadcasting facilities projects sometimes gets a bit hairy. As\n' (\nbeginners in quest of the holy grail in the form of government funds, you\n/' ' '/\nwill discover that the process is not so simple as.asking for some money\nand receiving a check by return mail.\nAs Deputy to the Associate Commissioner in both the Bureau in which\nwe were originally located and presently tooGrant Venn in the BAVLP,\nJohn Ludington has been familiar with the Facilities Program since its\nbeginning. We look back on the achievements of the original Act as having\nbeen considerably helpful to the development of ETV Facilities throughout\nthe country - and in many ways in which he has assisted us through the\nadministrative entanglements, John Ludington deserves a great deal of the\ncredit for those achievements. I know that he, as well as we in the\nbranch, are looking forward to the inclusion of the educational radio\nroustmmitv in this oracram - and it ^ives me a Great deal"
