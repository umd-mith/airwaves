  "text": "6\n4) Section 392 (a) (5) of the Act included in your papers is\nanother item calling for special reading. This paragraph\nrequires that an application must provide the assurance that\n“in the case of an application with respect, to radio broadcasting\nfacilities, there has been comprehensive planning for educational\nbroadcasting facilities and services in the area the applicant\nproposes to serve and the applicant has participated in such\nplanning, and the applicant will make most effective use of the\nfrequency assignment.”\nThis required assurance - together with theeother criteria relating\nto \"community service” and ’broadest possible educational uses” of\nbroadcasting facilities should be read very carefully end understood in\nits fullest implications by any one who hopes to establish a ten watt\nradio station under this Act. Or by any one who proposes to increase\nthe power of a ten watt station to eleven watts.\n5) The information in the Program Bulletin, perhaps, has greatest\nrelevance for the applicants vjho have ETV station applications\npending. Most of the program bulletin is intended to explain\nwhy we cannot immediately go back to the good old days and\nresume processing ET? applications where we left off. But\nthere are two items in the bulletin which should be especially\nmeaningful to prospective radio applicants as wall. One of\nthese is the notation that the state limitation for 1969 will\nbe $340,000 (as the Act provides, that is £1,;% of the appropriation).\nThe other is the section on State Educational Radio Agencies."
