  "text": "-5-\nI will limit my remarks to what makes a complete application, giving\nyou pointers in the areas where many an applicant stubs his toe, and, at\nthe same time, I will stress the areas where you can get the jump on the\nother fellow by doing some homework.\nNotice the form contains 7 Sections. Section I is a listing of\nprocedural Instructions and a Summary Profile of the Applicant.\nPlease follow carefully the Instructions in Part B, and pay special\nattention to the FCC requirements which must be met before processing of\nthe application can proceed, and to the Regulations and Instructional Manual\nwhich you must study carefully. You must constantly refer to them for\namplication of the various Exhibits requested.\nOn the right side of this first page, parts 3 thru 8, the applicant\nindicates his eligibility category, his compliance with the FCC, the State\nAgency, and the Civil Rights provisions; and in parts 9 and 10, he supplies\na succinct summary of the proposed project.\nThe purpose of this Section I is to provide the Program and Engineering\nevaluators of the EBFP with the necessary data to ascertain the applicant’s\ninitial readiness to proceed.\nYou are alerted to Part F of the Instructions which cautions you against\nincomplete applications which will be returned. This may cause an applicant\nto miss a stated deadline for filing which will force deferral of a project\nprobably to the next fiscal year, Since this is Radio’s first run to the\nend of the rainbow, there may be some * first time’ hurdles you fail to clear\nin the early going which will force a delay in grant award. However, careful\nscrutiny and thoughtful filling out of the Application Form will lift you\nover most of the delaying hurdles over which you have control, and keep\nunavoidable delays to a minimum,"
