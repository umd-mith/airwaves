As a Radio broadcaster, you have an obligation\nto provide a wide range of program services. Unless you have considered the\nentire range of needs of the community to be served for educational,\ncultural, informational, or enrichment programs, and your own willingness\nand authority to serve those needs, your project may not measure up.\nBy now, I'm sure it's becoming more and more evident that the APPLICATION\nyou submit is the key that unlocks the door to a share of the Federal gold\nat the end of the Radio rainbow. However, you have a qualifying heat to run\nfirst. So let's go now to the Application Form which is in*the folder.\nPlease' notice it is only a working draft and not for official distribution or\nuse.\nSince the final form will not be significantly different, this working\ncopy may give you a chance, if you so desire, to study the contents at your\nleisure, to become fully aware of procedures, and to decide how best to\nproceed. Also, the Application Form, rather than the Regulations or\nInstructional Manual,- at this point, is your best guide to the kinds of\ninformation which will be required of you."
