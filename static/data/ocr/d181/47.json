  "text": "-2~\nthe most significant radio projects which best meet the criteria for\npriority and present the strongest justification will be funded. Already\nthere are 65 contenders who will be striving to become a bona fide Radio\nentry,\nA quick summary of the Radio activity to date reads as follows;\nWe have received 50 letters of intent and know of 15 other possible\nprojects from the NER Questionnaire returns, making a total of 65 potential\napplicants from 32 States,\nOf these 65, 12 have indicated fairly precise approvable projects in\nfiscal *69. 25 have indicated projects which are probably approvable in\nfiscal ’70.\n13 have indicated possible projects, which are unlikely to be approvable.\nThat accounts for the 50 from whom we have had correspondence; the\nremaining 15, we know about thru the NER Questionnaire Returns which listed\n17 potential applicants, 2 of which we have heard from so far. So, adding\nup.the 65 \"probables\" to date, they total appropimately $2,500,000 in Federal\nfunds. And, we expect this list to grow almost daily which strongly suggests\nthe need to sell Congress on higher appropriations for P.L, 90-129,\nBefore anyone gets discouraged, remember that not all applications will\nbe approvable for various reasons which our review of the application will\nbring to light; and some that do get approved and accepted for filing will\nnot be funded for failure to meet one or more of the required conditions.\nAt the same time, I must emphasize that an approvable project simply\nmeans one which, after initial review, will gain the status of being accepted\nfor filing. And being accepted for filing is no guarantee of a grant award."
