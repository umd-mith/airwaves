The framework of the series set-up\na year-round calendar of events, geared to seasons and holidays,\nseasonal celebrations, sports, and activities.\n£) Basically, the series set up problems, showed conflicts, and^\nsolved the issues with the characters experiencing a new under¬\nstanding. Adults did not prescribe or moralize; the boys and girls\nin the series worked their problems out themselves, often without\nparental suggestion.\nMrs, Stanley then played a tape recording of the program \"Girl Trouble\"\nfrom the series, after which the group discussed both the program and the\nscript-writing points which it had developed.\nIn the course of the morning, the Seminar was addressed by Miss Esther\nAschmeyer, Consultant in Social Studies at Harris Teachers College and Co-\nChairman of the Social Studies Radio Planning Committee which works closely\nwith the staff of Station KSLH in planning social studies radio programs for\nthe elementary level. Miss Aschmeyer described the basic organization of the\ncommittee, which is composed of teachers, principals and social studies con¬\nsultants. Some actively teach the subject at the present time, others worked\nin the preparation of the social studies curriculum for the St. Louis schools.\nThese people bring to their meetings the needs of the classroom, and dis¬\ncuss these needs in terms of what radio programs can do to meet them. Out\nof such discussions come the area, the grade level, and the general content\nof a series which they want to have broadcast during the following year. For\ngreater efficiency, the committee divides into sub-committees, working on the\nprimary, intermediate, and upper grade levels."
