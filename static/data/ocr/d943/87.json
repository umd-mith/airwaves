  "text": "21\nThe last part of the afternoon was spent in a survey of teachers* guides,\nmanuals and handbooks, led by Edward Stasheff. Mr. Stasheff described and showed\nsamples of the various types of publications distributed by educational stations\nin conjunction with their broadcasts. These types include:\n1) The simple bulletin, providing little more than dates, times, and\nthe names of programs, with perhaps a short sentence about each in¬\ndividual program,\n2) The \"sampler\" type, such as the one issued by WBOE, Cleveland, which\nlists program titles of the coming year*s series. A fuller guide\nsheet on each specific program goes out several days in advance of\nthe first broadcast of each program.\n3) A full handbook or manual for a specific series, which outlines each\nprogram, provides background material, and suggests preparation of\nthe class and post-broadcast follow-up activities. One variation is\nthe group of manuals, for several series, in one binding.\nU) The weekly bulletin which points up special weekly shows.\nIn all events, the needs of the teachers determine the type of handbook\nbest suited to each station. For example, in one state, material on the his¬\ntory of that state filled a large manual and was a source book for the class¬\nroom teachers. But regardless of the type, the successful handbook makes the\nteacher*s work more effective and easier, and makes the program more attractive,\nthus more likely to be used.\nMaterials found in a great many manuals seem to show the following elements\nin most cases:\n1) A brief description of each program.\n2) Enrichment material for the teacher, frequently digested from source\nbooks which are also listed.\n3) Suggestions for preparing the class for the broadcast."
