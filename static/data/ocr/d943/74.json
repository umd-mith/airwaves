The good school patterns its instructional procedures on what is known\nabout the conditions which make for effective learning.\nA) The evidence from experimental research (and from common sense, too)\npoints to certain conditions which are necessary for effective learn¬\ning. Unless the radio writer1s materials take account of these nec¬\nessary conditions and are in consonance with them, the materials can¬\nnot be of much real help to teachers.\nB) Some of the more important of these conditions necessary for effective\nlearning are:\n1) Concomitant learnings — feelings of pleasure, or of boredom and\ndistaste acquired at time of learning.\n2) What you ask a child to learn must bear relation to the things he\nneeds and wants.\n3) If youngsters have a hand in shaping the purposes of what they\nlearn and planning the processes, they tend to learn better.\nU) Learning is more efficient and stays with them longer if the mate¬\nrials are challenging.\n£) Youngsters learn more readily and their learning stays with them\nlonger if the internal organization of the school is good.\n6) Learning is more effective if it emphasizes principles.\n7) Learning is at maximum when the rhythm of learning is understood,\nwhen the planned program includes learning, relaxing, and activity\ngeared to individual differences."
