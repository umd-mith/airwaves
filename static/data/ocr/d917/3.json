Here I stand alone above the\nOceanic sea, who knows for how long, I\nand the world alone, the world composed\nof earth and sky, and the round sea..,.\nEven my memories are fading... all is\nfar away: the scholars of Salamanca, the\nmockery which followed me from street to\nstreet on night in Cordova... all seems\nfar away. The stars above are shining,\nwaiting for the dawn... Nothing is there\nbut space and stars.. Space and stars.\nWe are sailing across the Oceanic sea.\nMay the words of Isaiah go with us:\nFrom the uttermost part of the earth have\nwe heard songs, even glory to the righteous.\nFrom the uttermost part of the earth\nhave we heard songs, even glory to the\nrighteous*"
