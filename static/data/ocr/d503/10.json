Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N. W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nIn Re: Memorandum of May 25, 1962\nDear Dr. Harley:\nThough this response is likely too late to have any\neffect upon what is undertaken in the way of an NAEB\nproject in TV program production I should still like to\nregister several impressions in this regard:\nn Though the memo was very carefully phrased to emphasize\nthe \"experimental\" nature of such an undertaking there\ndoes appear to lie implicit in it somewhere the idea that\na competing ETV Network is being considered. There are\nmany criticisms--some justified, I am sure--of NET's op¬\neration. However, our educational resources, especially\nfinancial ones are probably not yet so numerous that compet¬\nitive TV programming can be supported. If there are lim¬\nitations of quality in present programs it is not apparent\nto me how a dividing of our resources into competitive\nprogramming would correct the problem. The \"closed corpora¬\ntion\" aspects of NET's organization likewise is being\ncriticized--I too, protest--but how will this \"experiment\"\nalter that? '•\nIf the purpose of the project is to ascertain possible\nnew areas of financial support and to discover possible\nnew programming resources, then it could well have legit¬\nimate and significant value to ETV.\nThe possibility, however, of eventually having two\neducational network organizations competing for the philan¬\nthropies and beneficences of the same or similar donors\ncould do, I feel, great harm to the cause of ETV. \"If\nthe educators are in disagreement and at war among them¬\nselves, then let's give to neither\" idea could likely\nresult in a serious loss to ETV specifically and education\ngenerally."
