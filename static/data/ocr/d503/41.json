C.\nDear Bill:\nI did not intend to misrepresent the action of the Board, when\nI reported the two years rather than the two productions — but\nwhen I sent out my memo to the members of region VI I had only\nthe minutes of the TV Board to go on.\nI don’t as a matter of fact see much difference between two productions\nand two years, anyhow, for I think once the commitment is made, the\ndie is cast and the damage done.\nMy real concern has been that NAEB is moving into this field in the\nface of what I have been sure is the disapproval of the majority\nof ETV stations. I fail to see where the closed circuit people\nenter into this, for the closed circuit systems exist almost\nentirely to distribute direct instruction. The programs NAEB is\ntalking about are not designed for classroom instruction — for\nthat can only be done with a well developed series.\nAs to the vote on the Board, the brunt of the argument to alter*\nthe recommendation of the TV Board was carried on by radio board\nmembers who thought they saw an opportunity for NAEB to make some\nmoney. When the weak-kneed members of the TV Board saw the\nunanimous determination of the Radio Board, they found the\nstrength they could hide behind.\nBelieve me. Bill, I am not trying to cause you trouble — for you\nsurely know the regard I hold for you. I do feel strongly on this\nmatter, as you know, and I am sure other stations do, too. Please\naccept my assurance of my continued friendship.\nREC\nNAEB HE,\nRS\nJUIM 111962\nPM\nUniversity of Washington Seattle Public Schools King County Schools Seattle University Seattle Pacific College Seattle Public Library"
