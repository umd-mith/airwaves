  "text": "1. An educational TV series designed for domestic use, produced\non video tape under sub-contract by an NAEB member and under¬\nwritten by an outside donor.\n2 . A filmed documentary program or series designed primarily for\nforeign consumption (possibly in one or more foreign languages\nas well as in English), financed by a government agency,\nand produced directly by NAEB in Washington.\nNAEB would serve as general contractor for both series; in (1) the\nactual production would be done by an NAEB member station or closed-circuit\nproduction center, in (2) production would be done by a producer employed for\nthe purpose by the Washington office.\nThis is a production experiment. These contracts would provide for delivery\nof one completed copy of each program; they would not contain commitments\nregarding duplication or distribution.\nThis is my preliminary concept of the project. On the basis of your reactions,\nI will prepare a final and more detailed plan which will be communicated to you,\nas will subsequent reports on its development.\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTERS\n1346 CONNECTICUT AVENUE, N.W.\nWASHINGTON 6, D.C."
