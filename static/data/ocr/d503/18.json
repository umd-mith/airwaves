Harley, Pres.\nDear Dick, Ray, and Bill:\nNot being the manager of a TV station I did not receive\nwhatever inspired your memo of June 12 to the ETV managers\nbut I want to commend you for your reply, and especially\nto say ’’Amen\" to your comment that radio directors Miles,\nBrowne, Press and Paulu are all heavily involved in ETV\nactivities.\nEven if this were not so, it is in the nature of organi¬\nzational procedure that the Board of Directors should possess\nthe authority to act in executive capacity for the body else\nwhy have a board.’ It seems to have become fashionable to\ncall ’’cavalier\" or \"capricious\" any decision that runs counter\nto the wish of a vocal minority.\n1/\nThe matter in question was discussed thoroughly. All\nparties in interest had full opportunity to speak. The final\nvote with only two dissents speaks for itself, jj\nSi\nR.
