Skornia,\nNAEB,\n14 Gregory Hall,\nUrbana, Ill.\nDear Harry:\nWhile I think of it, would you as soon as you can\nexpedite arrangements for clearing the kinescope of the\nGutenberg Galaxy (is it via N.E.T?) so that it can be\nbrought into Canada right away without a great charge\nand fuss at the Customs. I rather think the CBC may\nbe interested and, if so, I can probably wangle kines¬\ncopes of The Teenager for educational circulation.\nWonderful about your coming up here to camp in\nJuly. There are nice spots within 40 to 60 miles of\nToronto. Shall send you some campint literature. One\npossibility would be for us to share a spot or have\nadjacent spots.\n. be ln Kalamazoo on a Communications Seminar\nat the University of Western Michigan, July 18 - 25th.\nApart from that we have made no definite arrangements!\nBlessings, y"
