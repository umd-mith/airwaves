Should any ideas for film\nclips occur to you in connection with any of the shots,\nplease scribble a note.\nEllery and Dreyfus think they can do it for about\n#400 out of our budget, and are charging this only because\nthey want to do it on a Saturday in order to do a better\njob. This will mean paying a few fees.\nA bit of luck while staying with Bob Shafer when\nKen McCrorie and his wife turned up, so they worked over\nthe script with me. He»s film man at Michigan State and\nhe approved the whole thing in principle just as it stands.\nThe form is not sequential, but montage, in order to re¬\nveal repetition of basic form in many simultaneous situa¬\ntions.\nEllery and Dreyfus consider that still shots will be\nquite useful, as well as graphics. But we shall strive for\na good deal of animation both in the cartoon and film form.\nSusanne Shafer is doing her Doctorate at Ann Arbor on\nthe effects of the American educational program in Germany.\nI have urged her to get in touch with you concerning radio.\n%* v tv\nxl\ncontinued.."
