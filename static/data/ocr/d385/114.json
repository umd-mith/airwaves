If we\nare able to carry out the production of your proposed script, it\nwould be Gary who is the individual on our staff most capable of\nputting it together. fcwill be necessary, however, for you and\nyour research assistant to bring with you to this program the\ngathered film clips, photos, and drawings involved.\nI checked with the Jam Handy Company here in Detroit which is\nprobably the world's largest commercial, industrial, and educa¬\ntional film house concerning the use of their film material. Miss\nLoma May, with whom I had contact, has suggested that she and\nyour research assistant get together in order to determine what\nmaterial is in the Jam Handy file that would be valuable to your\nproject. Miss May will not do any screening, etc. , with your\nresearch assistant, but will see that he is put into the proper\nhands. May I suggest that you consider the possibility of making\narrangements to send your man to the Jam Handy Company here\nin Detroit. An advance letter to Miss May would arrange this.\nMost of the material which 1 looked into concerning the types of\nclips in Sections 25 and 26 of the strip could be found at this\norganization.\nI was also told by a film man in town that it would be most bene¬\nficial to your project if your research man could get to the General\nMotors Photographic Division, which is headed by Mr. Bostwick.\nt believe that the Photographic Division of General Motors is in\nthe GM Tech Center in suburban Detroit. He also indicated that\nfiLm clips of this sort would probably be available in the Ford\nand Chrysler Photographic Divisions."
