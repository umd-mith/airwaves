Skornia,\nNAEB,\n14 Gregory Hall,\nUrbana, Illinois,\nU.S.A.\ncc: Research\nCommittee\ncc: Seibert\ncc: Foshay\nDear Harry:\nI had a most stimulating session with Warren Seibert\nin Washington on February 2nd. We reviewed the project so\nfar and settled on a new stress within the pattern already\nset up.\nSince the primary and over-all object of the project\nis to advance the understanding of media, and to develop\na means of promoting such understanding for the purposes\nof Grade XI instruction, stress had fallen on the idea of\na Syllabus and A-V materials.\nOur NAEB Research Committee had, in September, desig¬\nnated a procedure directed toward the experimental use of\nSyllabus and other materials in actual Grade XI class room\nconditions. We had not, however, developed any definite\npattern for testing the results of such class room action.\nThe state of knowledge about the media being what it\nis, the largest proportion of my own effort has been spent\nin gathering and extending such insights as I could achieve,\nespecially with a view to creating an adequate Syllabus.\nMore and more it becomes plain that no medium has its\nmeaning alone and that the older ones, such as book and\npress, are daily being modified by the new.\nIt was only two weeks ago that I hit upon the plan\nof charting 12 major media, including speech as medium.\nThis step had been taken as soon as I began to look at each\nmedium in terms of (a) its structural impact and (b) the\nsubjective completion elicited from each perceiver by that\nparticular impact.\ncontinued.."
