Marshall MeLuhan\nCulture & CaEEtunieations Seminar\n29 Wells Hill Avenue\nToronto 10, Ontario\nCanada\nDear Iterehall:\nIbis letter will set forth as clearly as possible the conditions of the\nnew media grant which provided you the funds for last year*a \"Under¬\nstanding Media\" project* I was asked to provide this letter since this\nproject came during my administration and 1 am more familiar with it\nthan the present President, William 0* Barley.\nFirst of all the project was your idea. The grant would not have been\nmade to us if you had not been available to conduct it, for we knew of\nno one else qualified to undertake it, so uniquely was it designed to\ncapitalise on your peculiar talents.\nIt was you who designed it and decided on the allocation of funds within\nthe overall budget. The IIAEB was only the intermediary essential, as\nfar as possible, to provide a necessary organisational pattern for super¬\nvision and reporting. This grant was in no sense commercial, and could\nnot have been made, from U. S. federal tax funds, except under the wholly\neducational auspices and within the exclusively educational framework\nthat enabled you to implement educational study and research.\nI hope this adequately sets forth the circumstances surrounding it* You\nmay use this letter in any way that may clarify the nature or terras of\nthe grant itself*\nf-l/c -\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTERS\n119 GREGORY HALL\nURBANA. ILLINOIS\nFebruary 15, 1961\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skomla\nFormer President (to HOw. i960)\nPresently, Mamber, Board of Directors\nCC: William G. Barley/\nHarold E. Hill 7"
