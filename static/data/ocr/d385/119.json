White\nDistrict Director\nInternal Revenue Service\nSpringfield, Illinois\nDear Mr. White:\nJune 8, 1959, you wrote to us (your reference AUD:BS 59 826) to the effect\nthat we would not have to withhold Federal income tax from the salary of\na Canadian citizen employed by us (hut continuing to reside in Canada and\ncoming to the United States only infrequently) so long as he was not pre¬\nsent in the United States for a period or periods exceeding 183 days dur¬\ning the taxable year and did not earn in excess of $5,000.\nTherefore, we did not withhold tax, nor did we fill out a W-2 form for\nthe employee nor enter his name on our final return for 1939* Shis week\nhe has informed us that, in addition to the exactly $5,000 he earned from\nus in 1959, he earned money from another United States source, and he request¬\ned that we fill out and forward to him a W-2 form. This we did and the\nGovernment’s copy is attached hereto.\nSince we acted in good faith, I presume that the enclosed W-2 form can simply\nbe added to our file in your office and that we will not have to file another\nreturn for 1959*\nDuring the current year, i960, this employee will be earning more than $5,000\nfrom us, and we have therefore been withholding tax from his salary, and\nhave handled it in exactly the same manner we handle withholding for our\nlocal employees. I presume that this is the proper procedure for us to be\nfollowing, but if it is not, I trust you will advise me.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nIflSHsJp\nEnclosure"
