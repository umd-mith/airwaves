Skornia\nPresident\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nMy apologies for having failed to catch the last check before\nit was sent to you. This should have been done and I note (again)\nyour specific request to this effect in the letter of February 12.\nIf you will simply return the unsigned check to Fiscal Management,\nOffice of Education, together with a brief explanatory note, the\nmatter can be taken care of. A copy of your note for our files\nwould be helpful.\nOur check of the files also shows that the NAEB project #279\nwas funded from fiscal year 1960. In view of the fact that you\nanticipate some surplus in the $30,000 paid thus far and in view\nof the fact that the surplus, if returned to us later than about\nJune 1 would be lost to Title VII, we wonder if it might be possible\nfor you to project your needs through the close of the fiscal year,\ncompute a reasonable estimate of the amount of surplus, and return\nthis amount to the program within 30-45 days. We will appreciate\nany actions along these lines which you are able to take.\nIf we can be of further assistance, please let us know.\nSincerely yours.\nWarren F. Seibert\nSenior Research Coordinator\nEducational Media Branch"
