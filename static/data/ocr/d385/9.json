Since some time has elapsed from then\nuntil now, I do not remember who did what to whom and for how much.\nI realize that one of the things that tied this up is that the origi¬\nnal billing came to Wayne to be paid by Wayne University. We then\nhad the billing remade to be paid by the NAEB Media Research Project,\nattention of Professor McLuhan. All of this delayed it in such a man¬\nner that it was sometime in September before the bills arrived. I am\nsure that this was part of the confusion involved.\nOur Educational Television Foundation is on an extremely limited bud¬\nget and is almost in a precarious position from a financial point of\nview. Consequently, I am most concerned that in no way should this\nproject, which involved the NAEB, Marshall, and Wayne State University,\ncost the Detroit Educational Television Foundation. Please see if you\ncan check on this for me and what the situation is for having the bill\npaid.\nThough I may be leaving myself wide open, I think I know you well enough\nto say that in the event this cannot be paid at this point by the NAEB,\nWayne State University will stand these costs. Dispite our budgetary\nsing, we cannot afford to have the DETF suffer any loss\nDr. Lee S. Dreyfus\nAssistant Director\nRadio and Television\nLSD/jam\nEnclosure\nCC: G. Fearnley, M. McLuhan, R.
