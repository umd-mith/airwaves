Not a leg to stand on. He has writtnn\nher lawyer and is sending copy of letter to Harold Hill.\nYou see, Nusbaum knew from first that in December, 1959, the\ncontract might end. So there is no question whatever of a whole\nyear's salary having been in play at any stage. I think Duffy\ncan terminate the matter.\nGlad I told you about Nusbaum when I was in Urbana. Just an\noperator.\nAm off to Ottawa to work with Philip Deane on some articles on\nmedia and politics. tfe will appear on GBC in this connection\nto comment on the Kennedy-Bixon debates.\nCordially\nc.c.\nMarks, Cohn and Marks"
