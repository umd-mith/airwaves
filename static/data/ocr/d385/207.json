Skornia,\nNew Yorker Hotel,\nNew York City, N.Y.,\nU.S.A.\nDear Harry:\nPhoned you in Urbana to-day, and got your New York\naddress. Phoned the New Yorker Hotel and left a message\nfor you to call me at home, in the evening, or here\nWA. 3-4614 - Ext. 43, by day.\nAll I wish to check with you, Harry is the matter\nof what I should send to Washington over and above the\nChicago-Detroit and Toronto schedules for class room\ntests. You mention that I should include the materials\nthat I am using in the class room, but earlier you had\nspoken of these being somewhat too sketchy, or as insuf¬\nficient. I can explain to USOE that these materials are\nnot presented before class, but are simply for their\norientation during the actual time I am in the class room.\nI shall attempt, then, to give very condensed out¬\nlines of the grammar of each medium, sort of half a page\na piece single-spaced.\nIn this connection, the last few days have seen a\nmajor break-through in media study. Working with the fact\nthat each medium embodies one or more of the human senses,\nit struck me that we are impelled in perceiving each medium\nto complete the scale, or spectrum of our sensorium. So\nthat, radio for example impels us to provide a visual world\nmoment by moment, and photography, which is so adequate in\nvisual terms compels us to complete the tactual and kines¬\nthetic part of the sensorium. Thus the degree of sensuous\ncompletion is one way in which the lines of force in anv\nmedium are structured.\nJAM CLo-rry fWLi\nC\\1/VCJV\\ ! ^\n/M.\n-continued*...\ni JajCSUUI"
