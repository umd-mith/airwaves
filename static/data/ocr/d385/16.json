It*s\njust possible that the Philip Deane piece a\npropos of television and the elections may be\nof some use to you at some point in the con¬\nvention. Deane and I are working up a series\non the new electorate.\nOne peculiarity of TV is that when a man stands\nin front of a TV camera, he cannot represent a\nparty or a country. The TV image simply strips\noff those dimensions, unlike movie or press\nphotography. In the same way, Eisenhower can\nmeet one head of a state at a time according\nto protocol; but if ten heads arrive at once\nhe cannot even meet them as president of the\nUnited States. They are just so many guys\nmeeting in a hotel. This is characteristic\nof electric media as such. They do not address\nan audience, but include it in the image.\nOne basic aspect of the new electorate, thanks\nto TV, is the shift away from consumer values.\nThis is mistaken for the new conservatism. TV\ncompels a do-it-yourself attitude which is not\nat all the same as individualism in the older\nsense.\nA lot has been happening on the media front.\nHope to see you at the Columbus conference\nOct. 28-9. Getting back onto campus has not\nproved very easy, but I do wish I could have\ngone out to San Francisco.\nWarm regards,\nrnanMJi"
