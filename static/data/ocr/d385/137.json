It should be\na good show. We shall really nail the media to the teenager\nmastj showing how and why it has happened that the teenager\nhas replaced the communist as public enemy #1.\nHave finally in hand Theorie De L1Information et\nPerception Esthetique by Abraham Moles, and just as I had\nhoped*,\"he swings our whole media problem in the Systems\nDevelopment direction. Shall report further when I have\nread more.\nA recent meeting with our own Electrical Engineers\nlead to their taking off my charts to translate them into\ntheir language.\nI am looking forward to talking with Gordon Wilson at\nM.I.T. soon.\nIf you look at our media charts such as they are in their\npresent form, you will see that in each case the HD or cons¬\ncious corner records private values and the LD or subliminal\ncomer reveals collective patterns. This, I did not plan.\nThis is the way it is. And does it not say to us that where\nwe can maintain consciousness, even concerning the collective\nitself, we are also maintaining individual values? The col¬\nlective pressures are relaxed as soon as we become aware of\nthem.\nThe first 50 pages of the ABC of Relativity by Bertrand\nRussell, Mentor Books, is the best thing I have ever come\nacross for spelling out to the unconsciously print-patterned\nman why he cannot conceive the nuclear world. Russell starts\noff on page 1 by stating that a complete reorganization of\nthe perceptual and imaginative life is necessary.\nBlessings,"
