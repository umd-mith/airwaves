  "text": "Dear jy&rshall:\nThis letter -will set forth as dearly as possibly the conditions of the\nnew media grant which provided, you the funds for last year’s \"Understanding\nMedia\" project. I was asked to provide this letter since this project\ncame during my administration and I am more familiar with it than the present\nPresident, William G. Harley.\nFirst of all, the project was your idea. The grant would not have been made\nto us if you had not been available to conduct it, for we knew of no one\nelse qualified to undertake it, so uniquely was it designed to capitalize\non your peculiar talents.\nIt was you who designed it and decided on the allocation of funds within\nthe overall budget. The MEB was only the intermediary essential, as far\nas possible, to provide a necessary organizational pattern for supervision\nand reporting. This grant was in no sense commercial, and could not have\nbeen made^from U. S. federal tax funds, except under the wholly educational\nauspices and within the exclusively educational framework that enabled you\nto implement educational study and research.\nI hope this adequately sets forth the circumstances surrounding it. You\nmay use this letter in any way that may clarify the nature or terms of the\ngrant itself.\nSincerely,\nHJS"
