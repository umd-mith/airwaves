  "text": "10 hours weekly. This means finding suitable\nreplacement programming for the PBL. programs\nof Sunday night which ends April 27th, and maintain¬\ning the full schedule of programming for the un¬\nlimited future which is otherwise scheduled to end\nat,the present contract. May 31st.\nb. In addition we seek capability for expanding\nprogramming certain nights and on different\nnights thus giving us a degree of flexibility we\ndo not now have.\nc. We agree that the Childrens Television Workshop\nis a necessary network series at 10:00 a. m.\nd. In the future, perhaps a year from now, we will\nneed considerable additional hours, such as 7 days\na week, 3 hours a night plus 2 hours in the day, not\nonly for all the above purposes but for additional\nprograms, specials and previews.\n6. • Dollars may or may not be available for new programming.\nCertainly no new dollars have been committed to replace\nPBL. On the other hand. Ford and Corporation dollars\napparently can continue through September, 1969, all\nother things being equal.\n7. I emphasized the promise as well as good preliminary\naccomplishment by the regional networks in use of their\nown hour of service weekly and that we were investigating\nour proper role as ETS/PS in scheduling the other hour\nof programming weekly which is currently ours.\n8. I described the MI-COM presentation we had received\nearlier and indicated that we didn*t yet know enough\nabout it to pass judgment, but that it was interesting and\nwell worth pursuing so far as determining its true capa¬\nbility and cost for the future, and that we should make no\nsecret about it to AT&T so they will understand that we\nhave indeed begun investigation of this alternative system\nas a future possibility.\nCHM/bb"
