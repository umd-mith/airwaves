Certainly this is an area in\nwhich I believe ETV can provide expanded service, and I know John Macy\nbelieves this too.\nI wanted to give you these personal recollections in order to show\nyou why I have such confidence in John Macy. I know you can put your\nconfidence in him as well. He has had a rich background in education\nand public service, and is well aware too of the great capabilities ETV\nand radio offer. You will find him to be responsive, competent, dedicated,\nand responsible. We are all fortunate to have him on educational broad¬\ncasting's team."
