It must therefore offer something\nmore than worthwhile programming. If the audience\nis to find it at all, this service must have a clearly\ndefinable character, or sound. Just as listeners can\npick out certain rock and roll stations the minute they\ntune to them, so must listeners be able to identify\nthis sort of programming in a flash.\nWe believe this can be done -- that a service can\nbe produced that will be distinctive as to quality and\ncontent, and also as to the '’sound\" it makes. This\nprogramming would have to be offered daily in large\nblocks of time over stations that reach influential\npopulations in large cities. Other stations would,\nalso, presumably, want to broadcast the entire offering\nof this service. Many would for various reasons pick\nup only part of it.\nBut we propose that a group of five to eight\nstations form the nucleus of the network, help determine\nits policies, provide basic production facilities for\nprogram origination, and commit the necessary amounts\nof their own air time to a single format. These stations\nwould become the key affiliates of the system and would\ncreate the system's public identification.\nOther optional affiliates would take from the\nsystem whatever programs they wanted, either live or\nby tape delay, and thus extend the coverage of the best\nprograms. Presumably, stations from this optional\ncategory would be added to the nucleus from time to time.\nIt is important to note that this system is not\nseen as the only possible national public radio system.\nFor example, one cannot deny, the value of the contribution\nbeing made by the Pacifica Foundation and its radio\nstations in special, radical, no-holds-barred intellectual\nprogramming.
