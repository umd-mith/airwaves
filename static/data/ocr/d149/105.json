Gunn, Jr*\nGeneral Manager, WGBH\nWGBH Educational Foundation\n125 Western Avenue\nBoston, Massachusetts 02134\nDear Hartford:\nThe enclosed reaction to your Public Radio System\nModel has been sent to those attending the Nov¬\nember 8 meeting in New York, to the National Edu¬\ncational Radio Board of Directors and to Ward\nChamberlin, Robert Swezey and Don Quayle*\nNAEB/NER has not taken an official position on the\nquestion of radio interconnection* As you undoubt¬\nedly know, the unofficial view is that interconnection\nis — in the Jong range — essential for the future\nof public radio.\nIt is interesting, I think, that the problems stem\nnot from the ultimate goal but rather from the means\nto accomplish the goals.\nYour model and my reaction to it are at widely sep¬\narated points in the spectrum. Perhaps, after addit¬\nional reaction and review, there should be further\ndiscussion among those interested. Those agencies\nasked to support an educational radio network will then\nunderstand what is required.\nOne possibility is that after the CPB-Ford study of\npublic radio is completed about March 1, funds be sought\nto employ a staff to develop a precise networking plan.\nWould not the Ford Foundation and the Corporation for\nPublic Broadcasting agree with this suggestion?\nSincerely,\nRAM:Ikl\nEnclosure\nRobert A. Mott"
