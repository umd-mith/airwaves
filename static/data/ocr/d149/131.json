Other standard formats include the\n\"all talk\" station on which people call the* talkmaster*\nand put their opinions on the air, and the \"all news\"\nstation (only a few of these) where the same news\nheadlines with variations are repeated over and\nover again. In a few cities, classical music is\nbeing supplied by FM stations, and in many cities,\n\"middle-of-the-road\" music has proved popular on both\nAM and FM outlets.\nEducational radio has never been national, either\nin interconnection or in programming or in coverage.\nOf the over 300 educational stations, a great majority\nare low power stations designed to serve colleges and\nother institutions. Many of them perform useful\ninstitutional services such as training students of\nbroadcasting or providing a lively extra-curricular"
