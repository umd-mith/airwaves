Harley\nPresident\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTERS\n1346 Connecticut Avenue N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20036\nDear Bill:\nIt is with pleasure that I inform you that the Corporation\nhas approved your request for funds to enable you to\nrelocate the facilities for the National Educational\nRadio Network in Washington, D.C. This grant is made\nin response to the proposal submitted to the Corporation\non January 23 by Robert Mott, Executive Director of\nNational Educational Radio.\nIn the proposal Mr. Mott detailed the total costs to\neffect this relocation at $22,610. In further dis¬\ncussion with Mr. Mott, he indicated that he felt his\ncost estimates were accurate if indeed not conservative.\nWe therefore will grant up to this amount and it is\nunderstood that if the total funds are not used during\nthe grant period of July 1, 1969 through June 30, 1970,\nthat the balance remaining will be returned to the Cor¬\nporation. Since that is the case, I would suggest that\nthese funds be maintained by you in a separate account.\nOn July 1, 1969 I will send to you the Corporation's\ncheck for the full amount of this grant. It is my\nunderstanding that this move of the duplication facili¬\nties can be accomplished during a period of June 24\nthrough July 2nd of this year. If there is any change"
