The program\nand production expense would depend also on the number\nof hours, complexity of presentation and the talent or\nformat involved.\nIn short, the cost variables are very great. Before\ntrying to present some cost data, it would be desirable\nto determine how much receptivity there is to the basic\nidea, what sort of limits for the financing might be\nexpected and whether the possibility exists of reduced\nAT&T tariffs or alternate (satellite-Canadian or U.S.)\nmeans of interconnection.\nToward the goal of determining the next steps, if any,\nthe planning group suggests that a meeting to discuss this\nsystem be held by Fred Friendly of the Ford Foundation &\nFrank Pace of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in\nmid-December."
