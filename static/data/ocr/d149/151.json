I trust you received it.\nI*ve some second thoughts about a glossary of terms.\nFirst, I discover that the National Catholic Office\nfor Radio and Television (NCORT) at One Rockefeller\nPlaza, New York has published such a glossary. If\nyou review a copy you*11 find It is generally satis¬\nfactory but it unfortunately does not define some of\nthe language used in our facet of broadcasting*\nFor example, terms excluded are#\nPublic Radio\nNon-commercial Radio\nEducational Radio$\nInstructional Radio\nCampus Radio\nCollege Radio\nPerhaps a liaison can be established whereby edu¬\ncational broadcasting•s terminology could be included\nin an updated version of the NCORT Glossary*\nFinally, I*m reluctant to impose our definitions on\nothers. Since a rather extensive study is being made\nby Samuel Holt of Educational Radio it might be that\nHolt and his crew could offer the best definitions\navailable.\n1*11 await your reaction. It was good talking with\nyou and we are looking forward to continuing our excel¬\nlent association with the Corporation for Public Broad¬\ncasting.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM: lkl"
