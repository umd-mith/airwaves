Quayle\nGeneral Consultant\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n555 Madison Avenue\nNew York, New York 10022\nDear Don:\nIt was good to meet with you and Bob Swezey Feb¬\nruary 14. Delighted you could join our brainstorming\nlunch and participate in one of those unique experiences\n— an NAEB party!\nThe discussion we held in the CPB office was highly\nsatisfactory from my point of view. I have some\nover—the—weekend reflections.\nWould you object to the National Educational Radio\nBoard of Directors meeting in conjunction with the\nMarch 13-14 gathering of the CPB Radio Advisory Com¬\nmittee? The board would meet on Friday afternoon and\nSaturday morning following the CPB sessions.\nThe advantages to NER are obvious. Our budget does\nnot allow, at present, more than two meetings per year.\nSince the board will be gathered for other business, it\nwould be most helpful if they might meet to take official\nactions which otherwise would be delayed to May at our\nnext regularly scheduled meeting.\nThe Recorded Materials Distribution Center proposal is\nmost interesting. It has great promise and potential.\nThe key, in my thinking, is timing. Although educational\nradio has considerable flexibility in the route it\ntakes to certain goals, I am concerned that the momentum\nthat is starting to build will not continue if radio\nplanning becomes too intertwined with television. I\nsupport the joint effort concept but feel that our pro¬\nposal to move NERN from Urbana to Washington, D. C. should\nbe pursued. This is a matter of urgency for radio and\na decision is needed — as Indicated in the proposal —\non or before March 31. To leave the move in limbo for\nan extended period of time would be detrimental."
