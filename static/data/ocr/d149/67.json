Chamberlin\nVice President\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n555 Madison Avenue\nNew York, New York 10022\nDear Wards\nJust a note to express my appreciation and thanks for\nthe assistance you have provided National Educational\nRadio in the past months.\nIt occurred to me in the flurry of activity surround¬\ning John Macy*s appointment, that CPB had functioned\nin admirable fashion recently and I wanted you to know\nI thought so.\nWhile we have not gotten along as rapidly in radio as\nI had originally hoped, my contacts with Bob Swezey\nhave been excellent. Since Don Quayle came on Board,\nwe have made additional progress.\nSam Holt advises me that the Public Radio Study is\ngenerally on schedule. That is good news and we are\nlooking forward to the completion of his work and\nrapid progress following Sam9s scrutiny of non-com¬\nmercial radio.\nSincerely,\nRobert A.
