The result\nwould be more program service for more stations and their\nlisteners.\nThe phasing would provide a pattern of expansion that should\nbe consistent with the resources available to the Corporation\nfor Public Broadcasting.\nThe time frame proposed:\nI. Planning Phase\nII. Initial Operation\nIII. Limited Operation\nIV. Increased Operation\nV. Expanded Operation\nVI. Extended Operation\nDate to 30 June 1969\n1 July 1969 to 30 Sept. 1969\n1 Oct. 1969 to 31 Dec. 1969\n1 Jan. 1970 to 31 Mar. 1970\n1 Apr. 1969 to 30 June 1970\n1 July 1970 to 30 June 1971\n(3 months)\n(3 months)\n(3 months)\n(3 months)\n(12 months)\nTwo assumptions are made in putting forth the phased concept.\nFirst, that interconnection costs will be available to NPRS at\nfree or reduced rates for variable periods of broadcast. (Pre¬\nviously tariffs have been such that it was uneconomical to plan"
