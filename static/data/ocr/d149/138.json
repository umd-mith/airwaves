Groups within these areas\nshould be encouraged to create such stations. Title I\nfacilities funds should be sought by the Corporation for\nPublic Broadcasting to aid in their development.\nThere appear to be stations in the other major cities\nthat.do meet most or all of the criteria and who have\nexpressed a willingness to commit to the idea of the\nNational Public Radio System - WGBH-FM, Boston; WNYC-FM,\nN.Y.C.; WUHY-FM, Phildelphia and KQED-FM, San Francisco."
