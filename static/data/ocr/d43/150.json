  "text": "Mr. Graydon Ausmus — Page 2\nDecember IB, 1953\nThe application was made first to the Fund for the Advancement of Adult\nEducation because Sf their wellknown interest in television. It was\ntransferred by them to the Fund for the Advancement of Education because\nthey did not feel that elementary and secondary education came within the\ncompass of adult education.\nAnything you can do to help spur this Fund into action will be deeply\nappreciated. It was a pleasure to have dinner with you the other night.\nI hope you enjoyed your show. JThe Rockettes performed beautifully, as\nusual, in a Christmas theme. Perhaps I shall see you at East Lansing\nnext month.\nWith kindest regards.\nBelmont Farley, Director\nPress and Radio Relations\nBF:hc"
