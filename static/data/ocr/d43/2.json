I\nhave been out of Chapel Hill since just before Christmas.\nAlthough I do not know Harry Scomia personally too well\n(I have met him only), I believe on the basis of his out¬\nstanding work in radio he would do a fine job. Therefore,\nI vote for him.\nI believe also that the arrangement Prank Schooley and\nJim Miles have suggested for the interim operation is\nfine.\nMy very best wishes for the New Year.\nEarl Wynn\nW b"
