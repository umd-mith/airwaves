C.\nDear Anna:\nGlad to serve on Radio and Recording Committee# Want to\nhelp work out problems. Glad to observe Marguerite Fleming is on.\nHer viewpoint has held us back a little, and full discussion, with\nher in on it, will help clear the way, I believe.\nAre all those asterisked Co-Chairman? Or what does asterisk\nmean? Maybe new? Is list full committee or only list of \"vacancy-\nfillers” as heading leads me to expect?\nI do hope this committee can meet in person, so we can really\n\"get down to cases.\"\nRegards,\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nHJSjcr"
