Check newspapers or your local ABC-TV station to\nconfirm exact day and time for your area.\nDISNEYLAND for 1955-56 will follow the same general format as in\nits first year. With this program, which in most areas is scheduled in\nthe evening, we hope to appeal to the broadest possible audience.\nThe family unit, our mail tells us, is frequently gathered at the\ntelevision set when this program is aired. Thus, we seek to build into it\nentertainment values for adults as well as for children.\nWe were not surprised when the public found pleasure in some of\nour theatrical film productions which were part of the show last year.\nMore of these will appear this year. We were, however, pleasantly\nsurprised at the fine reception given to such programs as\n“Man in Space,” “Operation Undersea,” and other programs highly\ninformative in nature. This year we will do even more\nprograms of this type.\nWe recognize, too, that the public has both affection and respect for\na courageous, honest American called Davy Crockett. He will return\nwith new adventures based on some of the legends which have\ngrown up around him.\nThus, in the DISNEYLAND series\nthis year we seek to offer a wide\nvariety of subject matter, but, most\nof all, we seek to entertain,\nWe are pleased that the three fine\ncompanies who sponsored the first\nyear of programs will again be our\nsponsors for 1955-56. They are:\nAmerican Dairy Association;\nAmerican Motors, Inc., and\nDerby Foods, Inc."
