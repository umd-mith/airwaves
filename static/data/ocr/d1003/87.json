Even the most elaborate lab can be\nself-supporting for a student fee of $5 per semester. This will cover all\ncosts* including maintenance* repairs and replacements* individual tapes\nfor all students* and obsolescence of all equipment.

By means of a detailed questionnaire* complete\ninformation will be obtained* tabulated* and published* probably sometime\nin 1955* This will be the first full and authoritative treatment of the\nwhole subject.\nA good many articles on the subject have been published. A fairly\nrepresentative sarcpling is cited in the bibliography.\n17.
