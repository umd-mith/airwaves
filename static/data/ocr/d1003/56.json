Where possible, differentiation has been made\nin the needs according to size of the institution and according to the varying\ntypes of centers; i, e., whether the center is charged with (a) improvement\nof college instruction only, (b) instruction plus teacher education, or (c)\ninstruction, teacher education, and off-campus distribution.\nAppendix E contains pictures and descriptions of some of the types of\nequipment useful in audio-visual centers. Appendix F gives the names and\naddresses of companies manufacturing and/or distributing AV equipment for\nclassroom and auditorium use, for light control, and for AV centers.\nIt should be noted that most planning committees tend to underestimate\nthe space needs of instructional materials centers, Remember that demands\nfor audio-visual services are growing rapidly on campuses and that college\nbuildings are used for many years.\nIn small institutions, spaces may serve two or more related functions.\nOften folding partitions prove very useful for such combination rooms* Some\nspace efficiency seems to be introduced as centers grow larger, so that large\ncenters accomplish more than small centers with relative amounts of space.\n1, Reception Area\nWithin the center itself, adequate provision should be made to handle\nefficiently, effectively, and in a friendly manner the personal visits made\nby the center1s patrons. An attractive \"customer” area should be provided\nwith proper facilities for graciously receiving the patrons. A lounge, with\nprofessional literature; catalogs and reference materials; displays of new\nmaterials; pleasant surroundings, which encourage browsing; and a genuinely\ninterested receptionist, should be an integral part of the area."
