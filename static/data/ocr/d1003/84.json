This is superior to the instructor’s live voice\nbecauses (l) the recorded voice makes no fluffs; (2) various voices and\nevents can be recorded and re-used indefinitely; (3) replaying provides re¬\npetition of identical stimuli; (I4) exactly timed pauses of silence for\nchoral response are possible and very stimulating. However, group listening\nto a loudspeaker requires a homogeneous group, all doing the same thing at\nthe same time.\nSimultaneous listening to various voices or languages requires individ¬\nual headsets, as in the U. N. A selector switch or dial enables the listener\nto tune in the language or lesson of his choice. In this situation, vocal\nimitations or responses to questions require acoustically treated individual\nbooths, else the bedlam of voices would drown out the recordings. As a\nresult, we find the typical language lab: a group (anywhere from a few to\na hundred or more) of semisoundproof booths, each with a selector dial and\na headset wired to the master players (usually tape recorder-reproducers)\nat the master station. A single technician or assistant can operate the\nmaster players. He may also take roll, or the student may punch a time\nclock. The more*elaborate installations have a panel at which the assistant\ncan monitor any booth.\nEvidently there is a close parallel here with the science make-upfclab.\nStudents work on their own, and the supervision may be merely perfunctory.\nAttendance is more or less required, but the instructor is not present and\nachievement is noted by him only as it is reflected in classroom performance.\nSuch a language lab is avowedly but a supplement. Its potential value is\ngreat, but it depends upon expert tape-making, integration with the class-\nwork, and constant support by the classroom instructors. Without these,\nthe values are likely to be realized only by the talented, conscientious,\nand self-motivated students."
