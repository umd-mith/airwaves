As\nyou are probably aware, an organisation such as ours has to be ready to justify\nevery nickel it spends, and in view of the fact that we have been receiving\na great deal of material from overseas cm a coat-free basi3 (e.g. Goralskirs\nAsia tapes and 76 weekly quarter-hour programs from Graham Hovey, until\nlately our Rome representative) we would find such payment difficult if not\nimpossible* We would not have much difficulty over shipping costs.\n34*30 (but not over) would be the best time length. Better to run a little\nshort than long... A tape every couple of weeks would be frequent enough\nif the programs are not likely to date. We would release them at weekly\nintervals once we had all or most of them in hand... A dosen tapes were\nshipped to you throe weeks ago, so they should be arriving at any tin®.\nIf you don’t get them within a day or two after this letter, let us know and\nwe’ll put a tracer on them.\nThe outline of the series looks quite good, and we look forward to hearing\nthe program you plan to tapo tomorrow. When we have a more definite idea\nthat these will be definitely usable, we might at least agree to reimburse\nshipping costs.\nBest regards.\nSincerely,\nJohn Bolt\nNetwork Manager\nJHijy\ncc* Dr. Harry J. Skomia"
