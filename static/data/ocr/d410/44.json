I leave tomorrow for nearly two weeks of conferences again,\nI think he*s clearing everything with Sy Siegel on this. I think it would\nsave time if you write Bob directly, but send carbons to Siegel. !\n1*11 discuss with Bob the matter of payments possible, after usability is\ndecided on. I*m sure we can take care of part of your expenses. We have\nbeen spoiled by having received Hovey*s Letter from Italy for two years\nat no cost except postage, and Report from Asia, well over a year, also\nat no cost, to mention two of several, llovey did his while on a Fulbright\nwhich cost the NAEB nothing, of course.\nIn haste.\nHany J.
