Script writer for a psychological warfare\nunit - sovnds like it will be -very interesting work in an oxtrcsaoly interest¬\ning location.\nlour letter came this morning as Dr. S&ornia was on his way out of the office\non one of his periodic expeditions, and he asked m to write to you. Yes,\nwd would be interested in weekly quarter-hour tapes from Japan. Here’s the\nsituations\n1) We cm supply tapes and pay shipping co,sta. But x’o afraid we have no\nfunds to pay beyond this.\n2) We here at Urbana do not select the series distributed through our or-\nganisa&ion* as this is a function of ccmaittees of sabers. In this case,\nthe RAEB International Halations Gbenittee would have to make the selection.\nTherefore the first tapes should go to Mr. Seymour Siegel, Director, Radio\nStation WHIG, 25C£ ?imi>ipal Building, flaw York Gity. y*9 Siegel is the chair¬\nman of the oorsslttee which will tell us Aether or not to distribute the series.\n3) We are still osiperiencing some difficulty with customs entry clearance of\ntapes, though we expect to liave this cleared up very soon. Still, it may be\nvary helpful if you will do anything you find you can at your end to avoid\nthis difficulty. For instance, thamere latticing of a shipped package w?to-\ncorraorcial educational tape-recordings - Invoice enclosed\" may expedite\nmatters considerably.\n4) We can reproduce and chib trnoc at 7k or (preferably) 15 inches per\nsecond. The programs should run up to 13| minutes without opening and closing\nmatter or up to 14/ minutes with closing matter - never longer. (These times\nfor \"qusrteKvfco-or*' programs, which we prefer.)"
