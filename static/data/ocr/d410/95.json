( I have a public affairs progfam on WOSU-TV and can\nget over there to pick them up, but they are always filed away when I\narrive at night )#\nFinally, to whom should I outline a short taped series which I\nhave in mind to do this summer? It*s my expectation to be in Brussels\nfor the international Fair, and I*d like to prepare about 3 fifteen\nminute tapes ( color, facts, commentary, one key figure interview) and\nthen from Dubrovnik, Jugoslavia do something rather different with\nanother projected three programs; Profile on Jugoslavia. Could you\nuse or accept a series as small as three?\nCordially yours.\nCrosleg JCroadaistiwj Corporation\nSALES\nOFFICES\nCINCINNATI • NEW YORK • CHICAGO • SAN FRANCISCO\nHOLLYWOOD • DAYTON • COLUMBUS • ATLANTA • DETROIT"
