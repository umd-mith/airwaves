Your letter today advises\nme of the publicity treatment through B/T\nand stations which I think is excellent. It\nhas the proper amount of promotional quality\nwhile still being conservative and dignified.\nPrograms No. II and 12 to be recorded this\nweek and airmailed.\nMy own fate with Psywar is hanging in the\nbalance, for we are undergoing a terrific\nreduction-in-force owing to a $100,000 budget\nslice. I expect to be given notice any day\nand will fly back to the states quite soonij\nNeedless to say, I'm sorry to say goodbye to\nlovely Japan, but think it may be high time\nto buckle either into mass communications\nin some university graduate program or try\nfor a news job on an educational TV station.\nYour ideas on thi ? 11 be most welcome.\nI'll keep you posted on developments, of\ncourse!
