It\nwas truly great fun and pleasure to work out the material and\nto discover what remains of fast-fading”old Japan.”\nNow my plans call for a cross country trip from Los\nAngeles to Ohio, and I may very well stop off in Urbana to\ntalk with you and with Dr. Skornia, to see what prospects\nthere are in educational TV for a news director. In Los\nAngeles, by the way, I plan to talk with Kenneth Harwood about\nUCLA*s ” telecommunications ” PHD program which looks impressive.\nI presume that a PhD is still a requisite for acceptance In\nuniversity life... and I have decided on this.\nperhaps 1*11 have the pleasure of meeting you quite\nsoon, and I look forward to seeing Dr. Skornia again, too.\nCordially yours... and for the final tifane\nfrom Japan\nSayonara"
