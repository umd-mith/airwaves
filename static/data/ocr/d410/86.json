Since you are aware of university\nprocedures, I know you wonH be surprised if there is some delay.\nThe check is being sent to your Columbus address.\nWith orders coming in, some 44 stations had taken REPORT PROM JAPAN\nThis figure, incidentally, is very good for a fifteen minute\nprogram series, and you are to be congratulated. When all orders\nare in, we will send you a check list of the stations carrying\nyour series.\nThe release date of the first program is October 28, the series\nrunning from that date to January 13.\nHope to see you soon, probably before you read this.\nBest regards.\nCordially,\nREU/ok\nRobert E. Underwood, Jr,\nNetwork Manager"
