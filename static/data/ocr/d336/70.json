ANY TIME\nTHAT YOU HAVE A BUSINESS THAT IS OPERATING YOU CAN MAKE MONEY AND YOU CAN\nSUPPORT OTHER THINGS. YOU CAN HIDE A MULTITUDE OF SINS BEHIND THE TAPE NET¬\nWORK AND I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY FOOLISH TO ALLOW IT TO PASS TO OTHER HANDS\nEVEN THOUGH I REALIZE IT IS A TREMENDOUS DRAIN ON THE HEADQUARTERS STAFF.\nI DIDN’T MEAN TO BE SO LONG-WINDED BUT I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS.\nI KNOW YOU AND OTHERS DO TOO. I KNOW IT IS MERELY A QUESTION OF GETTING SOME\nFAITHFULS TOGETHER AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU TO TRY TO MAKE THOSE\nPEOPLE WORK TOGETHER ON THIS MOST VITAL ISSUE.\nJSMgw\nDlRECTOR ,\nWBAA\n—fc> jgJW"
