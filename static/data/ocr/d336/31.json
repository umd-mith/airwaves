  "text": "Professor Frank E. Schooley\n-2-\nMarch 19, 195^\nI feel sure that the handicapped person would be only too happy to\nwaive the death and disability benefit protection under the present\nprovisions of the Retirement Act if this were possible in order to\nsecure employment on a permanent basis. Since a person cannot legally\nwaive benefits under the Act, the above amendments to the Act were\nsubmitted to the University of Illinois Committee on Retirement for\nconsideration. This Committee failed to act favorably on any of the\nproposals during the 1953 session of the General Assembly. This\nmatter will again be considered by the Committee on Retirement prior\nto the 1955 session of the General Assembly.\nI will be glad to discuss this or other retirement matters with\nyou at your convenience and would appreciate any suggestions which you\nmay have which may be presented to the Committee on Retirement.\nVery truly yours\nEdward S. Gibala\nSecretary\nESG:lc"
