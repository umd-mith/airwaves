SO DID ERIC\nJOHNSTON, PRESIDENT OF THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA.\nBUT GEORGE N.SHUSTER, THE PRESIDENT OF HUNTER COLLEGE, ASKED THE\nF-C-C TO STICK TO ITS PRESENT \"NO EDITORIALS\" RULE.\nSTATIONS SHOULD BE GIVEN EDITORIAL FREEDOM, STUDEBAKER WROTE, TO\nHELP THEM CARRY OUT THE FCC'S AIMS OF \"PRESENTING ALL SIDES OF\nIMPORTANT QUESTIONS FAIRLY, OBJECTIVELY AND WITHOUT BIAS.\"\nCOLLEGES AND SCHOOLS WHICH OPERATE RADIO STATIONS, HE SAID,\nSOMETIMES HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING SPOKESMEN FOR ALL SIDES OF\nCONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS. HE SUGGESTED THAT THE STATION ITSELF SHOULD\nBE ABLE TO STEP IN AND GIVE OPINIONS \"WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE FAIL\nTO RECEIVE A HEARING.\" AND HE ADDED:\n\"SO LONG AS FREE COMPETITION OF DIFFERING POINTS OF VIEW FOR\nACCEPTANCE IN THE MARKET PLACE OF IDEAS IS MAINTAINED, WHY SHOULD\nTHE LICENSEE HIMSELF BE DENIED OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE? DOES NOT\nTHE LICENSEE'S (STATION OWNER'S) OBLIGATION OF PRESENTING ALL SIDES OF\nIMPORTANT QUESTIONS IMPLY A RIGHT, WHEN NEED BE, TO BALANCE THE VIEWS\nPRESENTED OVER HIS STATION, BY GIVING EXPRESSION TO HIS VIEWS? I\nTHINK IT DOES.\"\nJOHNSTON TOLD THE COMMISSION HE FEELS \"VERY STRONGLY THAT NO\nINSTRUMENT OF EXPRESSION, INCLUDING THE RADIO, SHOULD BE RESTRICTED,\nOPENLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE EXERCISE OF FREE SPEECH GUARANTEED BY\nTHE CONSTITUTION.\"\nSHUSTER SAID EDITORIALIZING WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE ONLY IF RADIO\nOFFERED A \"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\" FORUM IN WHICH THE EDITORIALS COULD\nBE CHALLENGED. HE SAID THIS ARRANGEMENT OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE VERY\nDIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT AND VERY HARD TO CONTROL. HE CONCLUDED:\n\"I AM THEREFORE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE MORE\nPRACTICABLE TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM IN PRACTICE, WHICH IS SIMPLY TO\nDISCOUNTENANCE SUCK EDITORIALIZING ALTOGETHER.\"\nWW502PES"
