However, otjiers disagree.\nRobert D. Leavitt, of the Hearst news¬\npapers, says that when fauseimile “has\ndeveloped into an economically sound\nenterprise ... its competition will\nrender obsolete the newspaper as we\nknow it today”. He says that the\nstandard nevvspaper has tivo advan¬\ntages over radio today—appeal to\nthe eye and permanence; facsimile\nhas both of these and in addition, it\nwill be faster and more convenient.\nAlso there is disagreement or\nwhether facsimile will quicken of re¬\nverse, the trend toward monopoly situ-\natiohs in the news. Some think it\nwill increase competition by making\nit possible for more persons to enter\npublishing (with less money. But. some\nothers disagree. Morris Ernst be¬\nlieves that facsimile “offers a further\nserious threat of establishing national\nnewspapers”. He said it is “not‘hard\nto imagine facsimile reproduction of a\nlarge metropolitan newspaper sent\never the ether with copies arriving\nsimultaneously on all the breakfast\ntables in the land”.\nQuestion of Censorship.\nEven if the facsimile newspaper\nturns out to be only a supplement, the\nquestion of how free it will be from\ngovernment censorship will be impor¬\ntant. It will be more important to\nthe degree that it supplants the con¬\nventional press.\n* AAA\nRadio stations have hot riiad free¬\ndom of speech in the same sense that\nnewspapers have freedom of the press\nsince 1927. By that year there Were\nmore persons wanting to broadcast\nthan there were AM channels avail¬\nable.\nnetwork, operator of WAAB at B\nton, hah applied for a renewal.\nThe FCC said that WAAB had\nbroadcast partisan editorials. This,\nit said, “compels the conclusion that\nthis licensee during the period in ques¬\ntion has revealed a serious misconcep¬\ntion pf its duties and functions under\nthe law.\nExchange of Ideas.\n“It is equally clear that, With the\nlimitations in frequencies inherent in\nthe nature of radio, the public interest\ncan never be served by ^ie dedication\nof any broadcast facility to the sup¬\nport of the lii&nsee’s own'partisan\nends. Radio , can serve as an instru¬\nment of.democracy only when devoted\nto the Communication of information\nand the exchange of ideas fairly and\nobjectively presented.\n\"A truly free radio cannot be used\nto advocate the causes of the licensee.\nIt cannot be used support the.can¬\ndidacies of_ his friends. It cannot be\ndevoted to the sdpport of principles\nhe happens to regard most favorably.\nIn brief, the broadcaster cannot be an\nadvocate.\nPublic Interest First.\nAirwaves Regulated.\nThe law of 1927, modified slightly\nin 1934, set up a licensing commission\nto regulate the use of the airwaves.\nThe commission was directed to grant\nlicenses and renewals only if “public\ninterest, convenience and necessity\nwill be served thereby.” (Licenses are\ngranted for a maximum of three\nyears.) From the beginning the com¬\nmission (then the Federal Radio Com¬\nmission, now the Federal Communica¬\ntions Commission) has worked on the\ntheory that “program service was a\nprime factor to be taken into consid¬\neration” in determining whether the\n“public interest” would be served by\nrenewing the license of a particular\nbroadcasting station.\nAAA\n“Freedom of speech oh the radio\nmust be broad enough to pro^vidp full\nand egual opportunity for the pres¬\nentation to the public of all sides of\npublic issues. Indeed, as one licensed\nto operate in a public domain, the li¬\ncensee has assumed the obligation of\npresenting all sides of important pub¬\nlic questions fairly, objectively and\nwithout bias. The public interest—\nnot the private—is paramount.”\n% ★ ★ A\nHowever, the officials of WAAB-es¬\ntablished that “no editorials have been\nbroadcast since September, 1938, and\nthat it is not intended |o depart from <\nthis uninterrupted policy . . . The sta¬\ntions has no editorial policies.” - Be¬\ncause of this the FCC renewed the\nlicense.\n* The most Striking use of the com¬\nmission’s‘powers as applied to news\nbroadcasts was the famous so-called\nMayflower ^ruling in 1941. The Yankee\nFCC Challenged.\n• “No editorial policy” was the policy\nof the entire broadcasting industry\nbefore and during the war. Now,,\nhowever, partly because of the immi¬\nnence of facsimile, some segments of\nthe industry are challenging the\nFbC’s right to examine program poli¬\ncies as “illegal and unconstitutional.”\nArthur D. Willard, Jr., of the Na¬\ntional Association of Broadcasters,\nhas said, “Where would the vaunted\nfreedom of the press be if the ruling\nof the FCC depriving radio of the\nright to editorialize were imposed\nupon the transmission of newspapers\nby facsimile ?\n“Where, indeed, would freedom\nof the press stand if ... a news¬\npaper’s editorial policy were-to be\nrequired as evidence of the deter¬\nmination of a facsimile application\nwhich might involve an.issue of ec¬\nonomic life or death for the paper ?\nWill newspapers in the future in\napplying for facsimile facilities be\nrequired to 'provide sustaining\npages, discussion pages and so on?”\n\" • AAA\nFormer Chairman Denny of the\nFCC has said he agrees ttf at a facsimi- '\nle newspaper “has got to have ex¬\nactly the same privileges and the\nsame freedom as |he newspaper which\nthe boy leaved on your doorstep that\nis printed with ink and type”.\n“Unconstitutional.”\nLegal advisers for the National As¬\nsociation of Broadcasters say they are\nconfident that the Supreme Court will\n, declare the FCC’s ruling a violation of\nthe first amendment to the Constitu¬\ntion—that guaranteeing freedom of\nspeech.\nRadio spokesmen admit that radio\ncannot now be completely freed from\ngovernment licensing, but they want\nto have federal supervision strictly\nlimited to the technical and engineer¬\ning sides of the industry. In this Con¬\nnection Byron Price, director of the\nOffice of Censorship in World War II,\nhas observed:\n“We learned in wartime that the\npower to license is the power to cen¬\nsor, whatever statutes and regulations\nmay say to the contrary.”"
