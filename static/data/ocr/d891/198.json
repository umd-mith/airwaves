These families are now deprived\nof the services of a local station which is qualified and prepared to serve\ntheir particular and localized needs®\nThis year WHCU won recognition in the form of a Peabody award\nfor outstanding public service® Over the past years recognition has come\nfrom virtually every institution devoted to the public welfare. Such\nrecognition comes not for the mere scheduling of spot announcements ground\nout in monotonous routine, but rather for the assumption of leadership on\nthe part of all members of the staff in the development of programs\ncarefully written and well produced, and designed to contribute materially\nto the success of community projects® For example, the City of Ithaca\nhas a Reconstruction Home for those who have been stricken by polio® Last\nyear, when the campaign lagged far behind its quota, we turned our station\nover to the patients of the Home, They became announcers and writers,\nsportscasters and actors, while our entire staff, with the exception of the\nengineers, stood by from sunrise to sunset participating only in appeals\nfor funds. During that one day, more money was raised for this cause than\nhas ever been raised in any campaign over a period of a month for such a\npurpose. I need not comment upon the self-evident fact that, through this\nevent, WHCU contributed substantially to the morale of these unfortunate"
