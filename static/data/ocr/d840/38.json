In Ann Arbor I was\nasked to investigate th/p5»8ibility of our running\nanother 1000-odd of the He^xsrt so that it\nmight bea€ffT^iK thH<bop men in all educational\ninstitutions. Here arV the facts at this end. Our\nmimeodrafihing service ir so overwhelmed with work at\nthis time that it would probably be mid-December\nbefore we could get/the run done. Wilbur is syupa-\nthetic\\to the proppwal, but our budget situation\n^forego some other important use\nthe paper for the run would cost.\n|becked the condition of the stencils (which\nused twice already) and am advised by the\nstenographic service that the: will still\nBOO clear copies before they begin to\nlorate seriously. Perhaps sons of the fcxecutiv©\nmembers could have the stencils run. Z\nwould be happy to mail the® to anyone who could.\nSince Siegel is willing to contribute the stamps f\ncan anyone else banal* the mimeographing?\n(2) fhe reference in Harry 3kornia*s letter to Hull of\n1Q/22/U9 to a survey of tape recorder brands and\nspeeds, this survey is closely tied to the develop¬\nmental work on the network idea. If Harry can and\nwill do this survey, I would be happy if he would go\nahead with it. lace the 'Hesearch Committee would be\nresponsible to the membership for this, as well as\nother tasks assigned to it, 1 would only suggest that\nHarry, aa a member of that Committee, either distrib¬\nute copies of the summary results of the survey to\nall members, or send it to me for that purpose."
