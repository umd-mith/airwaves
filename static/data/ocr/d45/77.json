Let8s\nhear from you.\nH.

I thought perhaps we\ncould devote a portion of our Region IV meeting to a discussion of this two\nweeks ago. Failing in that, however, I do have a number of recommendations\nprojected from our experience here at WOI.\nTo tackle the most difficult area first, I would like to see more quality drama\noffered to the network. Specifically, I have in mind something of the quality\nand stature of the BBC World Theater, but of 30 minute duration. These could\nbe complete unrelated plays, such as dramatization of short stories, or seri¬\nalized productions of longer works. What they must definitely not be, however,\nis \"amateur radio drama.\"\nIn the area of histoiy on the adult level, I think of several approaches. I\nwould welcome series in both American and European histoiy and I think particu¬\nlarly appropriate at this time, the history of Russia. On a more specialized\nlevel, the history of American industry and the histoiy of labor in America\nwould also be desirable and acceptable.\nI think that a thorough study of Americans ethnic groups* a sectional survey\nof our country, showing the differences in life in New England, the South,"
