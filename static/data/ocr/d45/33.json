Skoraia\n\"Dear Harrys j\nThe Paulus, H°veys and Greshkoffs are having a great time in the\nEternal City - and we all love NAEB and Senator Fulbright at this point*\nThis letter is a hasty business comment, though, not a gossip sheet.®\nToday my father relayed from London a proposal from Dick Hull that\nI attend a UNESCO TV meeting in London in July, and suggesting I\n5follow through with Harry Skornia, suggesting your availability.®\nMy father only paraphrased most of Dick9s letter, so that all details\nare not clear. However, I am sending off this note to indicate my\ninterest and availability. So....if the matter comes to NAEB attention,\nkeep me in mind. And...if additional representation is required from\nNAEB ranks, you might keep Creshkoff and Hovey In mind too.\nRegards,\nBurton*"
