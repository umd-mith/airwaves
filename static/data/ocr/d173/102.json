Look at all the flags, I wonder if It is\ngoing to be hot today? I hear there will be processions today\nand a band. Let us get dressed quickly and go downstairs & How\nI long to hear that band l\n.HURHIED_DRESSING and downstairs_\nCome along, Tocqueville, A little more brandy. You will never\nbe able to stand the strain of an American celebration unless you\nare first fortified with an American breakfast I\nNo, thank you, I^m not hungry; I mean, thirsty*\nCome, come, Tocqueville, you must bring your mind back from\nFrance, This is July the Fourth, not July the Fourteenth;\nIndependence Day, not Bastille Day^ We are about to witness\nthe National Celebration of a happy Democracy.\nAnd how much of this happiness and democracy can we teach to\nFrance? Do the two go together? I wish I knew. Bequmont,\nlast year I saw with my own eyes the carriage go by in the rain\nthat took Charles the Tenth into exile: Charles the Tenth, Louis\nthe Sixteenth^ own brother: the very last of the Bourbons;\nthe very last of the absolute monarchs. Now we have a\nconstitutional monarch; now we have the beginnings of democracy *\nWill that make us a happy and contented people, Beaumont?"
