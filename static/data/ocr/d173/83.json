The old country estimation of wealth has stayed\nwith us, though I hope and trust itfs somewhat diminished, 1*11\nadmit that every man works for it In America, and not quite every\nman does so in the old countries; all the same it doesn9t seem to\nme that wealth is quite as important as an idol, a snare, a deception,\nas this other thing. The worship of public Opinion is the leading\nheresy around here, in ngr humble opinion,\nton seem very tolerant in your views. Father Power, Is this true of\nall American Catholics?\nXt9s true of most of them, I should say; wo9re nothe largest single\ncommunion in Hew :&>rk* but we*re still in a minority. So X shouldn9t\nwonder if some of us are more tolerant when they belong to a\nminority than when they have the numbers on their side.\nBut even so, American Catholics seem to love democracy as much as\nmembers of other religions.\nOh, oertainly. And they take it away with them xihen they go abroad,\nX was hearing only the other day of a lady from Charleston, South\nCarolina. Very distinguished Catholic family, but the name\nx*ouldn9t mean anything to you. Tills lady was on a visit to Europe,\nand she paid a visit to Rome, How naturally she was anxious to\nhave an audience with the Holy Father; and she had an intro auction\nto one of the Cardinals, and sure enough, of course, he was very\npleased to arrange for her to attend a general audience; you know,\nwhen there9s a lot of people there and they all receive the Holy\nFather9 s blessing. But this wasn5t good enough for her. No,"
