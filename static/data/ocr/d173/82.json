In the first place, you seem to have no prejudice whatsoever\nagainst republican institutions.\nCertainly not.\nAnd in the second place, you seem to regard education as very\nfavourable both to morality and to religion.\nrtThe truth shall make you free.* Are you really so surprised?\nIn France the Church is certainly not at present on the side of\nrepublioanism.\nOver here there8 s such a thing as the separation of Church and\nState. Several of the States have It written into their constitu¬\ntions. Hew York State8s one of them. Let8s see: hot/ does It go?\nI5ve had it quoted at me by certain of my parishioners often enough\nthat I ought to bo able to remember it. HAnd whereas the ministers\nof the Gospel are, by their profession, dedicated to the service of\nGod and the care of souls, and ought not to be diverted from the\ngreat duties of their functions: therefore no minister of the\nGospel, or priest of any denomination whatsoever, shall at any time\nhereafter, under any pretence or description whatsoever, be eligible\nto, or capable of holding, any civil or military office or place\nwithin this state,18 And In case, gentlemen, you8re thinking that\nthe church is weakened by this kind of provision, let me tell you,\nunhesitatingly (and the Protestant ministers311 say the same) that\nthe reason why religion is as dominant as It Is In the life of this\ncountry is precisely because of this separation of Church and State.\nYou really feel that, Father Pouer?\n- I am absolutely convinced of it: absolutely.\nThere Is, of course, no established religion in America."
