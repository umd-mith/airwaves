It would scarcely be unfair to say that Madame\nde Sevigne had no clear notion of suffering in anyone who was not a\nperson of quality,\nI see what you mean; and that certainly isn9t true here. We have our\nfaults; but on the whole, I believe we?re a humanitarian people. We\nlike to think well of people; and usually we have a basic belief in\nfair play.\nBut, Mr, Governor, to return to the question of the soldiers.\nOh yes, the question of the soldiers. Why arenH there ary: 'that\nwhat you mean?\nExactly, It is remarkable to us that the streets of this city are empty\nof soldiers.\nOr is this just peculiar to the City of New York? We have alreacty’ been\ntold several times that New York is not, after all, America,\nNor it is; but vvjl won*t find much in the way of soldiers wherever you\ngo. As I said, we3re on an adventure; every man jack has a stake in\nthe country, It5s to his own benefit to live in a peaceful, happy\ncommunity. Everything, in short, is regulated, as far as possible,\nby enlightened self-interest.\nCould you give us an example, Mr, Governor?\nI could give you ten thousand; but here8 s one you can hang on to.\nThere was a fellow I knew in Massachusetts; carpenter, by trade.\nTHRDOP:"
