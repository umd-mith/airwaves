In eighteen twenty five; about six years ago,\nthe State of New York resolved to construct another, and still larger\nHouse of Correction, near New York City, This one, in fact* Elam lynds\nwas put in charge of the project. Do you know what he did?\nNo, Mr* Warden.\nHe took with him exactly one hundred convicts from Auburn, set\nthem up hers in a camp; a work camp; a silent work camp*\nWork and silence.\nExactly. Those convicts themselves built the first cell-block at Sing-\nSing. They worked unmanacled, and almost unguarded; at night, they\nslept in tents. And none tried to escape; not one!\nIncredible!\nIt created a sensation.\nBut was this due to the personality of Elam Lynds?\nIn part, I am sure it was. He was an ex-soldier; and truly a wan of\niron. He dominated those man by force of character. I’ll tell you\nWARDEN:"
