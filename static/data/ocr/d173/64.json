What\ndo you think of that, Hr. Dallas?\nIt seems so incredible that I don’t know what to think. I really don’t.\nWell, don’t strain yourself. Just remember a Yankee can do anything\nhe puts his mind to.\nSHORT QUICK BRIDGE.\nGood day, Mr. Dallas.\nI hardly dare listen to you. What have you been up to now?\nDon’t fret yourself. I’m pulling out. I made up my mind to go home;\nso I went to thank the Emperor and bid him good bye.\nVery courteous of you.\nWell, I couldn’t hardly do no less, what with him being so civil. Says\nhe, \"Is there anything else you’d like to see before you go back\nto .America.” ”Yes,” says I, ”there is,\" says I. \"I should like to get\na peep at Moscow.” I’ve heard tell a lot, you know, about their setting\nfire to the Kremlin, and I’ve read a great deal about General Bonaparte;\nbut it would ha’ cost me a sight of money to get to Moscow, and I wanted\nto carry my earnings back home to mother. So I bid him good-bye, and\noff I come. Now what do you guess he did next morning?\nI’ve no guesses left.\nWell, I vow he sent that same officer over, in full regimentals mi tv* you,"
