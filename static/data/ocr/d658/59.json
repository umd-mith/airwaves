  "text": "At the present time two studios are in operation. Three industrial vidicon cameras with\nsingle lens and no view finder are used in Studio A. In Studio B, two multi-lens, view¬\nfinder vidicons provide the source of the video signal. A variety of cameras and equipment\nwill be used as the project progresses. An experimental studio with fixed cameras, or\ncameras that can be controlled by the teacher, is being planned. Data are being col¬\nlected on the operation of the various installations that are developed.
