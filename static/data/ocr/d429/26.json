X believe, on the other hand, that it is a safe assump¬\ntion that these standard methods do not exhaust the field, that\nthere are methods as yet unthought of or, at least, untried* If\nwe are to continue to improve our instruction, we need to think up\nand to test these new methods* As in most creative thinking, no\nideas for new methods should be discarded immediately, no matter\nnow wild. The important thing is to have many ideas for later\nconsideration*\nOnce the goals, content, and methods are defined, we have\nthe elements for a three-dimensional structure which we can examine\ncarefully to see which cells make sense and whether we have some\nareas of content and some methods for reaching each of our desired\ngoals*"
