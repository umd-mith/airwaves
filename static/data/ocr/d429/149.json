  "text": "It seems to me this would involve studying children to determine conw\nparison effects, other than pure retention of subject matter, when they are\npresented a certain segment of information in written form as compared to\nother forms such as TV and radio.\nPhysiology and psychology — what goes on inside the subject when he\nreads that is different than what goes on while he is viewing TV for example.\nThis is something new for me, and difficult to put into words and may-\nnot be at all what McLuhan has in mind. But, if it is what he has in mind,\nsomething might be put together using some of the observations I have\nexpressed above^: that would be a little easier to comprehend than what McLuhan\nhas said - or this may be worthy only of the trashcan.\nGeneral Reactions:\nMcLuhan, from the tone of his letter, seems to feel hurt and left out\nof other activities (non-NAEB). To me, tying with stag lines, series, of\nbeys, etc., is carrying linear concept to the ridiculous.\nSuggested Budget (per\nyear)\nMcLuhan\n$15,000\nSecretarial\n4,000\nResearch Assistant\n6,000\nSupplies & Equipment\n1,000\nTravel\n3,000\nPublication and\nDistribution\n5,000\nSub Total\n134,000\nIndirect (1550\n5,100\nTotal $39,100\nIt probably really would take two years rather than one. The only advantage\nto McLuhan being in Urbana is that we could perhaps keep him a little more\n\"down to earth\". The two years to start July 1, 1959 - McLuhan is probably\ncommitted for the rest of this academic year.\nHEH (12/13/58)"
