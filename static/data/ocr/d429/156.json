Skornia\nExecutive Director, NAEB\n111 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\ni\nI wish I had been successful in reaching you by phone yester¬\nday afternoon to give you my reactions to your \"McLuhan project,\"\nfor I am sure it would have been much easier that way. \"What I say\non paper may not make sense, but here goes I\nThe over-all description of the project seems to me to be well\non its way. The title, however, needs to be strengthened, so as to\nmake it more easily identifiable as a means of improved teaching.\nThis same is true under \"objectives,\" and there should be indication\nsomewhere along the line that the course materials eventually could be\nincluded in programs of teacher training.\nIn trying to come up with a substitute title, I fell flat on\nmy face, except for an idea which goes like this: \"Redefining the\nRole of Media in Education.\" I did rry best to figure out a title\nwhich could begin with \"improved teaching,\" but inevitably it became\ntoo long and involved. I am sure that brilliant mind of yours won't\nhave any trouble, provided you agree that my suggestion is worth the\nbother.\nAfter reviewing the proposal of research information, I couldn't\nhelp feeling that if it is at all possible, you should duplicate those\npages from your original proposal which are pertinent, rather than\nask Norberg's office to refer back to them. I am fearful of the com¬\nplications, if only one complete copy of your revision is submitted for\nconsideration by the Advisory Committee.\nIt was, as always, good to see you and I hope there will be\nmany other excuses to bring you this way.\nBest wishes always.\nCordially yours.\n(Mrs.) Gertrude G. Broderick\nRadio-TV Education Specialist"
