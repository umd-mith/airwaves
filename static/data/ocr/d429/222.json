As soon\nas the artists liberated us from lineality into field theory,\na century ago, the idea of meaning as package or capsule as¬\nsumed a grotesque aspect. The idea of art as self-expression\nfaded out at the same time; and the Idea of the artist as\nworking with and through the media of public language and\ngroup awareness,took over in Baudelaire, Rimbaud, and Mstliame<,\nYeats, Eliot, Joyce and Pound made the same assumptions.\nAnd these assumptions hoick the artist from the Ivory tower\nto the control tower. He becomes an Indispensable person,\nnot a luxury. In quite the same way that higher education\nhas become a necessity of production.\n<HM»\nIt may well be that the artist will now merge with the media,\nrather than staying outside as ironic spectator and commen¬\ntator. Certainly the avant gardlsm of yesterday is more\nevident in the public than the private arts to-day.\n*##\nThe role of the newspaper in structuring the habits and as¬\nsumptions of human association Is obviously complex. For\nexample, in a recent Fh.d. dissertation on methods of teaching\nmedia In Grade XI, the writer mentioned, casually, that he\nassumed as the basis of all media teaching that the student\nshould become alert to the factors of program control. Thus,\nwho owned the station, or the movie studio, would be Import¬\nant for studying the type of programs emanating therefrom."
