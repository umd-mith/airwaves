Until his mechanization of the handicraft of\nwriting it had been unthinkable that students and readers everywhere\ncould have almost simultaneous access to exactly repeatable data.\nIt was this exactly repeatable character that made possible the\nmodern class-room, so remote in kind from the student pattern of\nantiquity and the middle ages.\nPrint, moreover, had a lineal and segmental bias which quickly\ninvested the minds and attitudes of educators with a new vision\nand grasp of many problems and possibilities which had been inacces¬\nsible to awareness or solution before print. And as we marched\non to a realisation of these new goals thej&ntecedent forms of aware¬\nness and education simply collapsed and were forgotten. Today,\nhowever, we are sc&cely ready to accept a similar collapse of all\nthat has been achieved by print and segmental analysis.
