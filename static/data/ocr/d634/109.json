The fig¬\nures also serve to gauge the worthi¬\nness of some shows, and in the\nj case of courses for credit a cost-\n| per-thousand can determine wheth¬\ner it is cheaper to beam the subject\n| on the air or teach it in classrooms.\nWTTW can’t afford to subscribe\nto any of the rating services but\nhas found the Nielsen and ARB\noffices here helpful in connection\nwith their study. Also it has been\npossible for the statisticians mak¬\ning the study to swipe a glance at\nrating books at other stations, so\nas a WTTW spokesman described\nit, the study was “our best gue^.s\nj based or available information.“\nAmong the sources was the Niel¬\nsen Are* Coverage Study No. 3.\n{Ir the rating nooks of ARB and\n• Nielsen, the educational station\nj usually found itself represented as\nI“Other ‘\nf^SOETf\nWednesday, November }<*, 1958\nUnlike entertainment - seeking |\naudiences, WTTW’s viewers, ac-1\ncording to the study, dial in on a\nper-show basis and seldom are\nhooked by adjacencies. Station is\nactually trying to encourage this\nkind of viewing and is promoting\nitself as a library” of the air.\nBased on ARB statistics. WTTW |\nfinds that an average of 2 57 pro- ,\ngrams are watched per week by i\npersons who watch the station at\nall. Translated into minutes, it\ncomes to an average of 80.63 over\nthe week.\nAverage audience share has been\ndetermined at 1.5-2%. Best rated j\nshows get around 100.000 viewers !\nlowest rated (the tv college courses’ I\nmainly) play to around 15,000. !\nShow s are not necessarily watched j\nby the intellectual elite, and there !\nseems tc he no predominance of!\nany /single income level.\nRealizing that it can only excite I\nan educational motive in a fraction !\nof the populace and that some j\npeople will not be reached at all1\nby an educational channel, WTTW !\naspires to get one- or two-program J\nvisitations per week by two-thirds I\nof the population in its area.\nStudies made by other educa -\ntional stations point up the pattern j\nthat audiences increase every addi- '<\ntionai year the station is on the '\nair. The gray-matter channels in\nBoston. Pittsburgh St Louis, San i\nFrancisco, Houston. Minneapolis !\nand Chicago “look” alike, using ap¬\nproximately the same program ,\nming, and find their audiences act- j\nmg alike Rate oi audience gain\nat each station with each new year I\nroughly coincides with the rate of i\ngain at the other educational sta-!\ntions. recent studies have found. 1"
