Skomia\nExecutive Director, NAEB\nlli- Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nSince my work at Columbia mil not begin until almost the\nend of September, I am trying to catch up on some of the\nwriting I have been wanting to do. Among other things, I\nhave wanted to write a brief paper on \"How to do a coincidental\nbroadcast study\" since we talked about it in Chicago over a\nyear ago. I believe that many of the NAEB member stations\nwould like something of this sort so that they could investigate\ntheir audience periodically#\nI am enclosing a draft of this paper for your reactions.\nSpecifically, I would like to know whether you think that\nsomeone of reasonable intelligence who is completely unsophisticated\nin research could,carry out such a study with only this paper\nas a guide, what suggestions you have for its improvement, and\nwhether the NAEB might be interested in distributing copies to\nits members.\nI am sending copies to By Crary and Chalmers Marquis also. By\nindicated at the research conference in Chicago that the Center\nmight like to make something of this sort available to its\nstations. The copy to Chalmers is simply a trial balloon - to\nsee whether it is clear to him and whether he feels that this sort\nof information or \"How to do it\" piece is useful for stations.\nAgain I apologize for the typing of the paper* This business of\noperating without a secretary is something which will take a bit\nof getting used to#\nBest\nSamuel L. Becker\nI4.6U Riverside Drive, Apt. 61\nNew York, 27, N.Y."
