Can you tall me if I can refer to Cohn &\nMarks and ask their help? 1 would at onoe, but not sure bow much work we should\ntoss at them under terms of your last meeting with them. Hope we get them\nlined up to help.\nDear Harry*\nKQAC has received word that a Lewiston, Idaho, applicant has filed for 550 kilo¬\ncycles in that city. Such a commercial station on SOAC - s frequency would pose a\nserious threat to our audience east of the Cascade Mountains. Katurally we will\noppose the application and attempt to protect our listening audience against such\ninterference.\nThis letter is to seek your suggestions and advice as m begin to prepare our\ncase. Can the H.A.B.B. assist xm in protecting KOAC? So far the plans have not\nbeen formulated here but we will probably come up with some sort of committee\nrepresenting the three interested administrative groupst the Chancellor\" s office,\nGeneral Extension Division (responsible for programs) and Oregon State College\n(the actual licensee). Actual steps toward protesting the Lewiston application\nwill probably come out of some such group here.\nIf you have suggestions for me I'll be glad to pass them along to the admini-\nstratlon as we plan the protest. Right now I'm in the prooess of summarizing\nthe unique program services which HOAG makes available to the audience and which\nwould be lost to the people in the area of interference. In addition, we know\nwe can harness the support of the county agents in the area, as well as those\nfolks who are now on our mailing list as listeners In the area.\nWe will sincerely appreciate any help you can gise us.\nHappy Hew Year2\nJames K, Morris\nProgram Manager\nooa Armand Hunter\nJohn Dunn\nFrank Schooley\nk"
