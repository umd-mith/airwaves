Kellogg Foundation\n250 Champion Street\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Maurice:\nMany thanks for your consideration of the\nthree proposals we left with you some weeks ago. Thanks,\ntoo, for your kindness in permitting revision to increase\nthe amount available for a seminar during the 1957-5B year.\nWe understand that this does not increase the total commit¬\nment.\nMemories still linger of the pleasant visit\nin Battle Creek, especially the lovely home you have. The\npleasure was increased immensely by the presence of your\nwife.\nI trust you*ll have a vacation sometime this\nsummer. Hope to sneak off a few days in early August myself.\nSincerely,\nFES:fmh\ncc: Dr. Harry J. Skornia\nFrank K. Schooley"
