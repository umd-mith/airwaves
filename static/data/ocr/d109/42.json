They dispose, and\ndon’t propose. xfibc If we wonder what they’ll do on supplemental requests (we're\nto) go ahead and they’ll decide. This should be very selective, rather than a\nlong list of pro ject-requeste. We need to propose (for magazine) in broader\nthan NAEB-only terms*\nWhich projects, which we propose, can become \"revolving funds\" to\nsupport the NAEB without outside help*\n1. of untender network?\n2. of headquarters?\nIn some cases, I felt it unfair to be thrown in and expected to develop\njoint (non-agricultural) projects with the NPAC, though I indicated our interest\nin closely working with them. What is needed from us is what we’ve not had\ntime or funds to do*\n1. Think, define, limit, clarify (xjdfc which in certain ETRC and\nother areas is tough)\n2. Consult with everyone else in the educational, broadcasting or\npublications business.\nOur tendency (mine particularly I expect, with the pressure of daily details,\nrequests, deadlines) has been preoccupation with items, details, \"dreaming up\nrequests\", instead of setting base lines. I've never had more questions asked\nme that I couldn't answer, or had more sharp (though generally just)\ncomplains against the \"MAEB Way of Life\" than were today put to me.\nI don’t know how many \"brass tacks\" had been hit with Bob before, but I\ncertainly hit itka them, and came away a wiser and soberer man. Can the NAEB\ncorrect the impression Kellog has that we're ready to pursue every proposal\nanyone drops in our hopper, instead of soberly defining what we're to do, within\nthe limit of minimum resources we're pxdxxkpxx pretty sure to have?"
