Indeed, the quality of pro¬\ngram content has increased generally.* Hhia is,reflected, among other factors,\nby the increase in inquiries received concerning the availability of network\nprograms both for private use and for further broadcast over commercial sta¬\ntions, and abroad, and by reactions from network members.\nContributing greatly to planning for future network programming was\nthe Fourth Allerton Seminar on Radio Program Planning held April 22-24, 1957,\nand made possible from Kellogg funds in our current grant. From these delibera¬\ntions by representatives of all phases of educational broadcasting came many\nexcellent program ideas which, when developed, will provide the network with\nmany hours of quality programs.\nIn addition, the network profits greatly from the grant-in-aid program of\nthe Educational Television and Radio Center. Resultant series, many of which\nhave won numerous awards, add to the prestige of the network and NAEB in\ngeneral. These programs are produced for broadcast over the NAEB Radio Net¬\nwork with later rights available for use over other stations and by audio-visual\ncenters."
