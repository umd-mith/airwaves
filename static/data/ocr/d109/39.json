After a pleasant lunch with him I began going over with him the (draft)\ngeneral form in which the budget request will be submitted, indicated, with outline,\nthe nature and contents of the report in preparation, which would accompany it\nand xk went over the items (which had been worked out with Graydon in my trip to\nTuscaloosa last week) for which to request supplementary funds (Publishing of\nCommittee reports and other outstanding items to give Kellogg-financed items\nequal form and distribution with others; request for Washington agftcx office;\nfixe Prestige Series on Americanism (suggested gxxgga&xfUMflaxljdtoj^\n(by Van Duyn on phone to lek Ausmus and me, when I was in Tusoaloosa) as good\nproject to propose; the kinescope for TV (see Hill report following CNO meeting)\ntraining for national organizations; In-School Grant-in-Aid; and the others we\ndiscussed.\nGenerally Bob wasn’t in a mood to consider or talk about specifics. His\nconcern was about generalities!"
