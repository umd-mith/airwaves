Schooley\nAssociate Professor of Journalism\nand Communications\nUniversity of Illinois\nGregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Frank:\nWhen you and Harry Skornia visited with us in May you discussed three\nproposals:\n1. A proposal for a study to develop and evaluate an\nin-school educational television program.\n2. A proposal for a seminar on research in educational\nbroadcasting.\n3. A proposal for a project on the development of read¬\ning readiness through specially designed television\nprograms.\nWe have given careful consideration to these three proposals and this\nconsideration has been made in relationship to our resources and commit¬\nments . Our decision is that we do not wish at this time to expand our\ninterest in the communication field. Thus, although the projects which\nyou describe seem very important to us, we can not give them favorable\nconsideration for financial support.\nBecause of the special importance of the proposed seminar on research in\neducational broadcasting, we are approving the request from HAEB for a\nrevision in its 1957-58 and 1958-59 budgets. These revisions provide\n$6,000 for seminars in the 1957-58 budget instead of $3,000, and nothing\nfor seminars in the 1958-59 budget instead of $3,000. This action does\nnot increase our total commitment to HAEB.\nI hope all goes well with you and yours and that you are having an enjoy¬\nable and profitable summer.\nSincerely,\nMFS/fh\ncc - Harry Skornia\nMaurice F. Seay"
