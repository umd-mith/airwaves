A new Washington newsletter,\nCflttitel Radio Reporter* furnishing its readers with \"inside news\", warns contin-\nually against the Threat ( a carefully-nurtured myth) of \"Government radio owner¬\nship\" and points out that radio, like the press, must fight to retain its free¬\ndom* ,\nThe average citizen (and legislator) does not know that American radio has\nbeen profitable beyond the wildest- dreams of its pioneers* He does not know that\nonly 1000-odd AM radio channel assignments exist in the U.S. and that no more are\navailable* He does not know that broadcasting frequencies are so valuable that\nstations have been selling for 10 and 21 times their net worth*\nThe average citizen does not know that about 30 clear channel stations ®nd 4\nnetworks dominate the radio scene, nor does he know that 40,000-odd individuals\nin the broadcast industry and a handful of major advertisers how have almost un¬\ninhibited control over the most powerful emotional force with which the public\nmind has ever been faced* Naturally, they resist any change in the status quo*\nCenter of much of the current storm is the FCC report on the \"Public Service\nResponsibility of Broadcast Licensees\"* It is the \"Blue Book\" which se ts up\ntentative standards whereby station program operation might be reviewed and eval¬\nuated at license renewal time* This publication was greeted with the familiar cries\nof \"Government domination\", \"censorship\", \"left-wing nonsense\" and was construed\nby the NAB as a step in the direction of federal control of radio* Many individual\nstation operators do subscribe to the FCC policy and views* But the official point\nof view is the view of the NAB leadership, which hopes to use the headman's axe.\nThe handwriting is clear—the conflict is essentially that of special privilege\nagainst the public interest* The danger is political—the new Congress ir under¬\nstandably intent on a certain amount of \"house-cleaning\".. It is our hope that they\nwill understand the NAB interest goes deeper and has other objectives than free\nspeech\" and \"Free enterprise\". Every member of the Senate and the House in every\nstate should be advised that this is more than a question of bureaucracy, and that\nthe broadcaster has responsibilities which extend beyond insuring the stockholder's\nannual dividend*\nR1CHAFD B* HULL, Radio ft01, Iowa State College"
