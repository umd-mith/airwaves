Director, Massachusetts Board of Educational Television, Boston\n111 represent the Massachusetts Board of Educational Television, along with Miss\nElizabeth McConarty of North Quincy High School. The Board was established in\nJune, 1953, and set up basically to furnish educational and cultural television\nprograms for commercial and non-commercial television stations in the Commonwealth.\nWe are charged with the responsibility of acting for the Commonwealth in matters\npertaining to educational television.”\nDr, Constance WarrenT former President. Sarah Lawrence College, New York:\nonly excuse for being here at this family gathering is my interest in the\npossibilities of ETV as an excellent medium for education. Since I’m not a repre¬\nsentative, shall I speak for the Tri-State area of Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire?\nNew Hampshire is the most interested of the three and so far, Mr. Ted Kingsbury of\nKenne has been the most active. For some time, Maine had difficulty, since their\nGovernor wasn’t particularly interested in the field, but now with the new Governor,\nand after a conference last year with 36 interested groups attending, Maine has a\ncommittee of 15 working on the problem. There was some talk of getting a trans¬\nmitter for ETV on Mt. Washington, but the people were so slow at moving on the\nproject, that Canada moved a channel even closer than it was and blocked out the\npossibility of using Channel 11 on Mt. Washington. It looks now as if New\nHampshire and Vermont will go to Mb. Kearsarge and leave out Maine, so Maine will\nhave to set up a station of its own in connection with the University. Yet there\nwill still be some degree of cooperation, as I hope there will be with our\nneighbor, Massachusetts. ETV is very important in these states - especially in\nthe rural areas.”"
