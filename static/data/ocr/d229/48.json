Hulsen\nDirector Radio Projects\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n1345 Avenue of the Americas\nNew York City, New York 10019\nDear Ali\nWhen I have traveled to CPB Radio Advisory Council\nmeetings I have paid my own expenses and feel that I\nshould continue this policy. The fact that the NER\nBoard has an opportunity to meet in conjunction with\nthe advisory council suggests to me that NER should\ndefray my expenses since I am not a regular member of\nthe council.\nHowever, I assume that it is appropriate to request\nCPB payment of expanses and travel connected with my\nSeptember 15-16 New York trip to review public radio\nstations and to participate in the briefing Cor the CPB fellows.\nPlease advise.\nOn another matter: I’ve written John Macy regarding his\nNAEB luncheon address on Monday, November 10 and sent you a\nblind carbon. We will ask a number of CPB staff members to\njoin Macy at the head table.\nCan you or an appropriate person on the CPB staff provide\nbiographical material on Macy for publicity purposes and in the\npreparation of an introduction at the luncheon. I’ll appreciate\nyour help on this detail.\nSuggestion on KCET: Develop a share time or share use facility\nwith one of the educational stations in the Los Angeles area which\nnow uses frequency in school hours only - up to four p.m. Perhaps\nas a starter an arrangement could be worked out - and eventually\nKCET could become the dominant figure."
