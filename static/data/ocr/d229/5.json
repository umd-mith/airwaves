W.\nWashington, D. C. 20036\nDear Bob:\nMy secretary was typing a letter to you on the subject, when\nI opened the morning mail and found in the Memo to Managers\nyour discussion of the \"recording\" amendment to the Public\nBroadcasting Financing Act.\nI am saying in this letter, of course, what I was saying in\nmy first one -- we are opposed to this amendment.\nAs we interpret the amendment, we (and other stations) would\nhave to tape record every newscast aired plus public affairs\nprograms we broadcast and save the tapes for a \"reasonable\"\nperiod (an article in Broadcasting suggested three months and\nspecifically mentioned news).\nThere is a principle involved. We’re already restricted\nfrom editorializing by terms of the 1967 act. We’re already\nrequired by the FCC policies, the Fairness Doctrine, Section\n315, etc., to be \"fair\" in our treatment of matters in the\npublic interest. This further restriction is unjust, and,\nabove all, totally unnecessary.\nBesides the principle involved, the mechanical and storage\nproblems would be unreasonable! If a station aired many news¬\ncasts during the day, and we air several, it would mean devoting\na single tape recorder to recording news and public affairs\nprograms, or else be constantly threading and unthreading (in\nthe event you wanted to use the recorder for some other purpose\nbetween news programs). And, too, three months after the\neffective date of the amendment there would be a continuing\nthree-months supply of tapes to store. And, although space-\nwise we’re probably better off than most stations, even for us,\nstoring three months of tapes would create a problem.\nTHE BROADCASTING SERVICE OF ARKANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY"
