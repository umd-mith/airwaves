It would appear that in a case where a station's impartiality\nor fairness is in question, the question is by its very nature\nof such moment that speed should not necessarily be of the\nessence in resolving the doubts. Thus the legislative history\nof S. 3558 dealing with the necessity to deal quickly with such\nproblems appears to be specious. The FCC now has the power to\nask the relevant questions that may arise and to expect honest\nanswers from the licensee under penalty of forfeiture. We feel\nthat such present procedures are quite adequate to insure the\nproper resolution of fairness problems.\n5. Legislative history aside, common sense tells us that at least\npart of the rationale behind the amendment is to provide members\nof the public or the government with additional weapons with,\nwhich to challenge station fairness or impartiality. While both\npublic and the government certainly have the right and indeed\nthe obligation to make such challenges, we feel that legislation\ndealing with the matter should not be proposed under the guise\nof protecting stations from possible unwarranted challenges.\nIn summation, we are of the opinion that the record keeping described in the\nSenate bill in unwarranted, does not in fact address itself to the problem it\npurports to alleviate, and is in present form discriminatory.\nWe urge NAEB to work for defeat of the concept in the House of Representatives\nor, at the very least, to attempt to eliminate the discriminatory aspects of\nthe bill as passed by the Senate.\nBest regards.\nSincerely,\nDonald D. Forsling\nAssociate Manager\nDF:mf\ncc: R.C. Mulhall-WOI\nStanley S. Neustadt-Cohn & Marks"
