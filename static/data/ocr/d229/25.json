Woods\nFrom:\nJohn Witherspoo\nI*m writing this not to sound the alarm, but because the alternative\nwould be to ask you individually about the proposed rule that would\nlimit radio and television combinations. I refer particularly to the\nreport in the August 4 Weekly Television Digest.\nI have the impression that the proposed rule is not a very popular idea\nanyway, but should it cane to pass, it would have some obvious implicar-\ntions for public broadcasting. In San Diego, for example, the only\nreal hope of developing KEBS-FM into a strong public station is to\nbuild its association with KJBS-TV. A number of the principal public\ntelevision stations are now seeking radio affiliates, and it seems to\nme that this is an essential development.\nI would appreciate knowing where we stand in the present FCC proceeding.\nSAN DIEGO STATE COLLEGE, SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, 92115 • 714/286-6415"
