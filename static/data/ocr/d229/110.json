  "text": "— -4\nNSA proposes the establishment of the National Communications Center. The Center\nwould develop and distribute radio programming covering a broad spectrum related to\nneeds in higher education and community development. Program production of Center-\ninitiated offerings would be the final responsibility of recent college graduates\nwith broadcasting expertise, under the employ of the National Student Association.\nContributors are seen particularly, but not limited to students and other young\npeople interested and working in campus and community situations. Student govern¬\nments, campus groups, and student-related community organizations would be encoura¬\nged to purchase low-cost, easily operable recording machinery. Universities would\nbe encouraged to subsidize the cost of such a purchase, and to make existing campus\nfacilities available to these groups. ’ .\nCampus and community noncommercial stations would be utilized both as 'stringers,'\nand as a source of interesting, high quality programs to be distributed on a na¬\ntional basis by the Center. ~ *\nIn all cases, the professional staff would have final authority over production,\nto insure program quality and high listener interest. (This is not to be interpret¬\ned in any way to suggest censorship of ideas or content: there would be none, ex¬\ncept as to general reasonableness and compliance with all regulations of the Federal\nCommunications Commission governirg program content and fairness.)"
