  "text": "TAKING ROOT\nA sign of the far-reaching - and deeply penetrating -\ninterest of all Americans in public broadcasting was the\nformation earlier this summer of the National Advisory\nCommittee of the CPB, with representatives of many of\nAmerica’s most broadly based - and forward-looking --\norganizations. Taking part in the first meeting of the\nCommittee in Washington recently were men and women\nfrom the following groups: The American Association of\nUniversity Women. Boy Scouts of America, Consumer\nFederation of America, General Federation of Women’s\nClubs, National Association for the Advancement of Color¬\ned People, National Conference of Christians and Jews,\nNational Council of Churches, National Council of Senior\nCitizens, National Congress of PTA’s, National League of\nCities, National Conference of Mayors, National 4-H Club\nFoundation, National Education Association, National\nWildlife Federation, National Audubon Society, U. S.\nJaycees, National Catholic Office for Radio and Television,\nand the League of Women Voters.\nAt the initial meeting, John Macy urged that local\ncitizens groups gear some of their community action\nprograms to discussion of critical national issues broadcast\nover public radio and television stations. He pledged CPB\nand local station cooperation with local groups to trigger\nhundreds of local “town meetings” around the country,\nbearing down on local microcosms of urgent national\nproblems.\nMr. Macy also asked the organizations to alert their\nmembership to news of programs of particular interest, for\nexample “Sesame Street,” the series of the Children’s\nTelevision Workshop, and others which might cover the\nareas of particular interest of the national organizations. He\nadded that public broadcasting would actively seek the\nadvice of the organizations on what programs are needed to\nmeet community needs. “We want our communications to\nbe entirely two-way,” Mr. Macy said, “because public\nservice is our only product.”\nHULSENJOINSCPB\nAlbert L. Hulsen joined CPB as director of radio projects.\nFor the past five years he had been manager of Five-College\nRadio in New England, managing WFCR, Amherst, Mass.,\nthe radio station operated by five colleges in the area:\nAmherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, Smith, and the\nUniversity of Massachusetts.\nMr. Hulsen also served on the faculty of the University\nof Massachusetts as an assistant professor of speech and as\nan instructor in education. Earlier he was program manager\nof WRVR, New York, program director of WGBH-FM,\nBoston, and public affairs producer of the Educational\nRadio Network. Last year he won an- Armstrong Award for\nhis radio documentary, “Cystic Fibrosis: Children with a\nChance.”\nIn 1966 A1 Hulsen made a study tour of public\nbroadcasting in Japan, Korea, and Samoa on a research and\ntravel grant from the Five College Committee on Asian and\nAfrican Studies. Earlier, he studied Korean on a fellowship\nfrom the Yale University Far East Language Institute. In\n1961 he was in Korea as assistant news chief of the United\nNations Command, and before that he was news and public\naffairs director at WOSU, Columbus, Ohio. In 1955 he took\na master’s degree in radio and television at Ohio State, after\ntaking a B.S. the year before from the State University of\nNew York. Mr. Hulsen has moved his home -- and his wife\nand three children -- from Amherst to Centerport, Long\nIsland.\nINNERSPACE\nJohn Macy has proposed that a domestic satellite now in\norbit be used for transcontinental interconnection of public\nbroadcasting network operations, as well as for other\nexperimental uses, such as a Satellite Cities demonstration.\nMr. Macy, on behalf of the major forces in public\nbroadcasting, made the proposal to the National Aeronau¬\ntics and Space Administration (NASA).\nNASA currently has two Applications Technology\nSatellites in orbit and available for experimental use. Mr.\nMacy proposes that use of them be assigned to public\nbroadcasting for four experiments: transcontinental inter¬\nconnection, a public radio network interconnection, a\nsatellite cities demonstration, and tests of network origin¬\nation from very remote and inaccessible locations.\nThe transcontinental experiment would bounce signals\noff the satellite from coast to coast, for relay coastwise by\nland lines.\nThe radio network experiment would use the satellite\nas a feed to th6 nation’s public radio stations, with pickup\non the ground by the stations.\nIn the Satellite Cities demonstration, there would be\ntwo-way traffic between the satellite and some six cities\nacting as the nuclei of regional networks and functioning as\ncenters for production and origination of national and\nregional broadcasts, and as main switching points for relay\nof broadcasts bounced from the satellite.\nHELPING HAND\nTo public television stations in Chicago, Cleveland, Los\nAngeles, New York, and Washington, and to the CPB, the\nNational Broadcasting Company is contributing grants\ntotalling $1,500,000. NBC operates television stations in\nthose five cities. The first grants to be awarded under the\nplan are $300,000 to KCET, Los Angeles and $500,000 to\nthe Corporation, both to be paid out over five years in five\nequal instalments.\n1345 Avenue of the Americas, New York 10019, Phone: 212-582-2020\n1250 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036, Phone: 202-223-2228/9"
