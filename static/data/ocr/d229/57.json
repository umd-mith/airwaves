Siemering, general manager of WBFO,\nsaid the satellite studio would also give ghetto residents\n\"an opportunity to air their feelings and grievances\npublicly, and get action on them.\"\nThe studio also gives ghetto people an opportunity\nto participate in the shaping of programs for broadcast.\nThrough it ghetto youth who want to learn broadcasting can\npractice the rudiments.\nJohn W. Macy, Jr., president of the Corporation for\nPublic Broadcasting, said \"the WBFO experiment like others\nbeing conducted by public radio stations in several other\ncities, will help find new ways for people in the ghettos to\nbreak out of the virtual 'communications blackout' in which\nthey were long isolated.\"\nMr. Macy added that the findings in the experiment\nwould be made available to all of the more than 400 non-commercial\nradio stations throughout the United States.\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting is an\nindependent, nonprofit corporation established under the Public\nBroadcasting Act of 1967 to help develop public radio and\ntelevision broadcasting through program and station support\nand establishment of interconnection systems.\n# # #\n69"
