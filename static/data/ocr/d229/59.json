Hulsen\nDirector Radio Projects\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n555 Madison Avenue\nNew York: City, New York 10022\nDear Ali\nThis will be a brief interim report on the CPB grant tiove\nmove NERN from Urbana to Washington, D. C.\nOur first financial report is due at the end of September,\nninety days into the project.\nPrincipally due to the terrible technical condition of the\nduplicating equipment broughtforward form Urbana, NERN has had its\ndifficulties in getting underway. In addition, we feel that Ampex\nCorporation has not been as helpful as they might have been.\nDespite these obstacles, I can report that after 45 days we\nhave maintained the network distribution schedule, improved the\ntechnical quality markedly, created a willing and competent staff\nand begun planning for improved programming in the October-November-\nDecember quarter.\nThe start up costs will be higher than we would like (though\nstill within bounds) due to the problem areas indicated above.\nConsidering the logistics of the m<jve - and looking back on it -\nI'm amazed that it came off as well as it did - and that we were\nable to provide uninterrupted service.\nI don't see any major problems regarding the move and operating\nsubsidy grant. A better time to rebiew it will be after the first\nthree months when the figures are available.\nX can report informally that the cost of the actual transfer\nwas within budget. I had some concern about this since the estimate\ncalled for a move of 25,000 pounds and 40,000 pounds came forward.\nFortunately, our planning allowed for some flexibility - which we\nneeded*\nIf you want additional details at this time on the moving grant,\np&ease advise.\nSincerely,\nRAM:kh\nTRobert A. Mott"
