C. 20036\nDear John:\nI was delighted to participate in the orientation for\nthe Career Fellows and hope ray participation was helpful.\nIn view of my limited contact with the Fellows during\nthe seminar, I do want to comment on the design of the\nworkshop. I have written Bob Carlisle indicating some\nreaction wiich I tope will be of value.\nAs A1 Hulsen and I reviewed the radio station responses\nto the inquiry CPB made relating to the criteria for a public\nradio station, I was struck by the inadequacy of manpower in\nmany of the stations. I certainly support your view that we\nface a serious manpower problem and that the Corporation can\nplay a vital role in its solution.\nAgain, thank you for asking me to participate.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM:kh"
