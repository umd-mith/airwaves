A1 Hulsen\nDirector of Radio Projects\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n555 Madison Avenue\nNew York, N.Y. 10022\nDear Al:\nThis will be one of those letters that can' be filed unless you maintain\none of those “Miscellaneous1' files. Personally, I don't like people who write\nsuch stuff.\nFirst, I want to extend belated, but sincere, congratulations to you in\nyour new position. It*a deserved recognition for you, and should be an out*\nstanding choice for educational radio people. You'll be blazing new trails,\nand I know you'll choose directions wisely.\nWe were pleased and grateful to be one of the lucky recipients of a\nprogram production grant. The project is well under way. First recordings\nfor “Nest of Singing Birds\" were made the weekend the check from the Corporation\narrived, I think you'll like them.\nAs for comments on the Public Radio Study, I would like to withhold idd.\\-\ntional comments for the present. As you know, I had a part in hammering out\nthe NER Board's position, which has been forwarded to you by Bob Mott. I en¬\ndorse the Board recommendations and feel it might be better not ts clutter\nindividual comments from others of the constituency with reiteration of the\nsame points at this time. Also, the Advisory Council will presumably be\ndiscussing at least some of Sam's recommendations in Madison.\nThe July 31-August 1 dates for the WHA meeting of the Advisory Council\nare fine for me — although I must confess to some trepidation about Madison\nweather at that time of year. It usually makes me either sleepy or grouchy.\nRegards,\nKK:mc\nKen Kager"
