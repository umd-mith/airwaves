Mott\nExecutive Director\nN.E.R.\n1 346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20036\nDear Bob:\nPlease find enclosed the responses to our solicitation of\nrecommendations for our Foreign Fellowship Program.\nI have resisted reviewing these myself and therefore have\nno special comments or instructions. As you will recall,\nit is our hope that we could provide each foreign broad¬\ncasting corporation with three candidates, so that the^\nforeign broadcaster could participate with us in the final\nselection.\nWe have received far fewer recommendations than we had^\nanticipated. As a result, it is conceivable that we will\nnot find a sufficiently qualified candidate among any of\nthe names. I am sure you will agree that it would be better\nto defer the fellowship than to recommend someone in whom\nwe may not have sufficient confidence.\nIn any event, I will appreciate your reviewing these recom¬\nmendations at the earliest possible opportunity and returning\nthem to me with your comments, judgments and observations.\nIt will be helpful to us if you will indicate your first,\nsecond and third choice for the Fellowships at BBC and CBC.\nSincerely,\nDavid C. Stewart\nDirector of Special Projects\nDCS:bg\nEnel."
