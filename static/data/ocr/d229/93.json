Stewart\nDirector of Special Projects\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\nSuite 630\n1250 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D.C 20036\nDear Dave;\nMy review of the applications for the Foreign Fellow¬\nship Program results in the following recommendation:\nFor the BBC 1. Jack Mitchell 2. Richard Calhoun\nFor the CBC 1, Juris Jansons 2, Richard Borstadt\nIt is my view that these four applicants are in a\ngroup by themselves.\nThree other candidates seem to fall in middle ground\nand might be considered. They are (in alphabetical\norder) Meuche, Pittman, and Richardson.\nI do not recommend any of the remaining candidates\nand suggest that only the top four listed be given\nserious consideration. I am unable to identify a third\ncandidate for either fellowship.\nI do not agree with your suggestion that it might be\nbetter to defer than to recommend someone in whom we\nmay lack confidence. The Corporation has elected to\ngo into the scholarship and fellowship program. Rav¬\ning made that judgment, and having received applica¬\ntions meeting the parameters, I believe CPB has an\nobligation to complete the selection process.\nI have made no attempt Jot/substantiate my selections\nbut I'm willing to discuss my selections if this\nis necessary of desirable."
