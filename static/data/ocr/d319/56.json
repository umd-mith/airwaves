Siegel\nDirector, WNYC\nMunicipal Broadcasting System\nMunicipal Building\nNew York 7, New York\nDear Si:\nAt the moment I see no reason for anyone having\nany anxiety about NaEB continuing in Prix Italia. So\nfar as I know everything is set for this year. I cannot\npresume to judge for future Board actions but I can\nindicate that our action this year was affirmative\nbecause we believe in the value of its continuance.\nWhile I may be wrong I assume that it is relatively\ntoo late to secure use of any funds in accordance with\nCliff Naughton»s suggestion. Personally I think we\nmight consider rather seriously the use of such funds\nin any future years.\nI believe this brings to you any comments on\nall questions you have raised within recent dates. If\nnot, load the cannon and fire away.\nSincerely yours,\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident\nFES:ftah\ncc: H. J. Skornia"
