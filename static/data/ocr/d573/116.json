Miller\nStation Supervisor KNER\nBuckner Orphans Horae\nRoute 4\nDallas, Texas\nDear Mr. Miller*\nIn reply to your request of September 26, I am happy to give you more in¬\nformation about the NAEB. Incidentally, I suspect that some of ray earlier\ncorrespondence to your organization has been misplaced. I set forth the\ndues and advantages of membership in my original letter of April 7, 1955,\nand then repeated this informa tion again, as a result of a request from\nMr. R. H. Lunda- who was then Station Supervisor, in a letter dated Septem¬\nber 8, 1955.\nFrom your recent letter I gather that you do have the various publications\nand other materials I sent originally, and those will give you an idea of\nsome of the services we provide. In addition to these miscellaneous re¬\nports all members receive our monthly Newsletter (copies of which were sent\nto you earlier), and we are always ready and willing to help you with any\nspecific problems you may have. We also make available certain grants each\nyear to permit the production of outstanding radio programs, and this year\nwe have instituted a series of Research Grants. I am enclosing copies of\nthese announcements for your information.\nWe are constantly ranking efforts to upgrade the professional abilities of\neducational broadcast rs through scholarships, seminars and workshops. This\npast summer we held three such meetings: one in TV Program Planning, one in\nTV Staging and Lighting and one in Radio Engineering. All of these were paid\nfor by us at no cost to the participants.\nOf course, one of the biggest advantages to membership, especially to a\nsmaller station, is the opportunity to use the services of our NAEB Radio\nNetwork, which supplies eight to ten hours of programming a week to those"
