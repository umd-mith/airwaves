Skornia, Executive Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Dr. Skornia:\nAt the suggestion of Kenneth D. Wright, I am\nwriting to you in regard to our efforts to develop creative\nradio programing activities on this campus.\nThis is a small university, and we do not have\ntransmitting equipment. However, we have just acquired modem\nstudios, and the local radio station, WREL (250 watts) is most\ninterested in transmitting any educational programs that we\ncan produce. We have had a news and commentary program on the\nair for a number of years, and last year we began a new series\nof student-produced documentaries, dramatizations, panel dis¬\ncussions, and other types of programs. None of these programs\nis sponsored, and no money is involved in any way.\nWith our limited student enrollment, it is\ndifficult for us to sustain a regularly scheduled program\nthroughout the year, and I have been wondering whether pro¬\ngrams of unusual interest produced by members of your\nassociation might be available to us for occasional use?\nWe are trying to build up listener interest and enthusiasm,\nand would be grateful for your help.\nVery sincerely yours.\n0. W. Riegel\nOWRrfc"
