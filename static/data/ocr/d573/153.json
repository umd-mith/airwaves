For this fee members receive our monthly Newsletter:\nthe NAEB Journal; the various reports and surveys we publish periodically;\nservices of our Placement Service, television engineer, legal counsel,\nmanagement consultant, etc.;plus the normal day to day services, informa¬\ntion and advice that any national organization gives its members. Under\nseparate cover we are sending you samples of some of the materials we\nregularly send our members, plus other items which will give you more\ninformation about the association. Of course. Associate, Affiliate and\nIndividual members do not receive as many of these materials as regularly\nas Active members do.\nActive members with radio stations may use the facilities of the NAEB\nRadio Network upon payment of an annual network fee. The Network distributes\napproximately eight hours of programming, by tape recording, weekly, to\nmembers subscribing to its service. This fee is also based on power (with\nthe same power classifications as membership) and a new station does not\nhave to pay the full fee until the third year it is in the Network. The\nfees are s\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\n1st Year 2nd Year 3rd Year\n$400.00 ISooTocT $800.00\n250.00 375.00 500.00\n150.00 225.00 300.00\nStations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to and\nfrom Network Headquarters here in Urbana, Illinois. Still even a Class\nA station paying its full third-year rate is paying only a little over\n$2 an hour far better than 400 hours of programming from the Network in\na year. This is about the most inexpensive programming a station can do.\nIf, after looking over the materials which we shall send you, you have\nfurther questions, we shall be most happy to answer them.\nSincerely,\nHarold E.
