McKann\n- 2 -\nJuly 24, 1956\nUnder separate cover we are sending you samples of some of the materials\nwe regularly send our members, plus other items which will give you more\ninformation about the Association. Of course, Associate and Affiliate\nmembers do not receive as many of these materials as regularly as Active\nmembers do.\nIn addition. Active members with radio stations may use the facilities of\nthe NAEB Radio Network upon payment of an annual assessment fee. The\nNetwork distributes approximately eight hours of programming, by tape re¬\ncording, weekly, to members subscribing to its service. This fee is also\nbased on power (with the same power classifications as membership) and a\nnew station does not have to pay the full fee until the third year it is\nin the Network. The fees are:\n1st year\n£400.00\n250.00\n150.00\n2nd year\ni\n$rd year\n$00.00\n500.00\n300.00\n£600,00\n375*00\n225.00\nGlass A\nClass B\nGlass C\nStations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to and from\nNetwork Headquarters here in Urbana, Illinois, Still even a Glass A sta¬\ntion paying its full third-year rate is paying only a little over $2.00\nan hour for better than 400 hours of programming from the Network in a\nyear. This is about the most inexpensive programming a station can do.\nAmong the materials I am sending are a few that may prove helpful to you\nin planninp a station. If, after you*ve looked over all the materials,\nyou have any questions, please let me know.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEHs.lmf"
