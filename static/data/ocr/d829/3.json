Kenneth Roberts\nHouse of Representatives\nOffice Building\nWashington, D, C.\nDear Ken:\nIn President Kennedy’s news conference, he was asked what\nhis attitude was toward ETV. His reply was that he wasn’t\nsufficiently informed to make a comment, I am certain that\nhe is familiar with educational TV but probably was not in a\nposition to summarize his attitude at that time. Inasmuch\nas the President has already made printed public statements\nendorsing ETV, I would assume that his reply this week did\nnot indicate a lack of interest, even though it may have been\nunderstood over the air as such.\nIs there some way that the subject might be brought to his\nattention without seemingly taking exception or building a\nmountain out of a m&ehill? May I suggest that, if Opportune,\nyou bring to his attention casually the importance of edu¬\ncational television in the United States. Please let me know\nif you think such an approach is practical and if you can\nparticipate in it.\nWith kindest personal regards, I am\nSincerely yours,\nRDH/ml\nRaymond D, Hurlbert\nGeneral Manager"
