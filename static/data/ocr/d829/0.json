Hurlbert\nGeneral Manager, Alabama Educational\nTelevision Commission\n2151 Highland Avenue\nBirmingham 5, Alabama\nDear Ray;\nI have received the carbon copy of your letter to Bill\nHarley commenting upon the recent JCEB publication, \"A Report\non ETV Legislation.\" While 1 know that Bill will respond to\nthis, I feel compelled to make a few observations for purposes\nof clarifying the record on this matter; particularly inasmuch\nas Secretary to the JCEB, I was responsible for the drafting\nof this document which was approved by all members of the Joint\nCouncil.\nAs the document itself makes clear, the NAEB is, of\ncourse, a member of the Joint Council and has been for years.\nIndeed, Bill Harley is presently its Vice Chairman. Before\nthe draft was even sent to the membership, Bill and I went over\nit carefully together. The matter of selecting appropriate\ncomments was no easy matter, for many who were \"in the fight\nfrom the beginning\" could not be listed because of a balance\nof representation which we attempted to achieve as well as the\nrequirements of brevity.\nWe felt that Alabama would be adequately and most effectively\nrepresented in the document by the statement of Representative\nRoberts on page 9. We did not list persons directly connected\nwith (and representing) operating ETV stations or~networks feeling\nthat this would appear too self-serving. I continue to believe\nthis judgement is sound. We felt that to list Alabama's Governor\nas well as Representative Roberts would be an over balance in a\ndocument which in our view would only be effective if it were\nvery brief.\nOne further observation, twenty thousand copies of this\ndocument have been prepared and distributed by the JCEB. Into\nthis effort has gone no small amount of time (and overtime) on the\npart of a small staff, to say nothing of the financial sacrifice"
