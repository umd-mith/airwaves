  "text": "PERSPECTIVE\nSchool Aid in New Dress\nby Raymond Moley\nThere is now pending in the House\nRules Committee a bill (H.R. 132)\nto make channels available and to\nprovide Federal subsidies for ed¬\nucational television. This legislation\npassed the Senate last year almost\nwithout notice and with little or no\ncomment. But while the Federal\nmoney involved is relatively small, as\nthe bill becomes better known it\npromises the same controversial issues\nwhich ended in the defeat of Presi¬\ndent Kennedy’s omnibus Federal aid-\nfor-schools proposal last September.\nThe radio-TV spectrum is a rela¬\ntively scarce and strictly limited nat¬\nural resource controlled by the\nFederal Communications Commission.\nThe FCC has reserved 268 channels\nfor educational purposes. Only 54 are\nin use at the present time. The ar¬\ngument is that state and local public\nagencies must have subsidies from the\nFederal government to avail them¬\nselves of these channels because it\nis costly to provide the technical and\nother facilities to use them effectively.\nThe bill would authorize total ap¬\npropriations of $25,520,000 to be\nused in matching funds provided by:\n“(A) an agency or officer responsi¬\nble for the supervision of public ele¬\nmentary or secondary education or\npublic higher education within [the\nstate] . . .\n“(B) the state educational televi¬\nsion agency,\n“(C) a college or university deriv¬\ning its support in whole or in part\nfrom tax revenues, or\n“(D) a nonprofit community edu¬\ncational television organization.”\nTOOL FOR CONTROL\nThe restriction of Federal grants to\npublic schools would exclude private\nschools of all sorts, just as was true\nof the lost Federal aid plan of\n1961. Because of discrimination, the\ngroundwork is thus provided for an¬\nother strong protest from churches\nsupporting their own schools.\nA much more serious aspect of this\nproposal is the immense tool which\nsuch an educational facility would\nprovide for Federal control of the\ncontent of education by the Federal\nbureaucracy, in this case by the U.S.\nOffice of Education. It invites brain¬\nwashing of children, students, and\nthe public by a Federal bureaucracy.\nThe same bit of hypocritical seman¬\ntics barring control by the U.S. Com¬\nmissioner of Education is present in\nthis bill that has been in all Federal\naid to education bills in the past. But\njust as was the case in last year’s bill,\nactual control will be contrived to put\nthe materials devised by an educa¬\ntional elite in Washington into what¬\never is called education.\nENDLESS POSSIBILITIES\nThe U.S. Office of Education, quite\nunwisely from its point of view, could\nnot wait until the bill might pass in the\nHouse unnoticed as it did in the Sen¬\nate, but issued a report by one of its\nperennial panels which revealed how,\nunder the National Defense Educa¬\ntion Act, it would plunge into the\nbusiness of telling states and local\nagencies what to teach. The report\nsays that a “nationwide talent search\nand training program” is needed, etc.\nAnd everyone knows that whatever\nis “nationwide” is the USOE.\nUnder the provisions of the bill it\nis easy to see that as the federally\nsubsidized channels are used up the\nCommissioner of Education will be the\ndictator as to who shall get these\nlimited resources. And when the\nchannels are all used, there will be\nnone left for private schools. There\nis also a gadget for further Federal\ncontrol in that the Commissioner of\nEducation would plan and encour¬\nage interstate groupings of the users\nof the channels.\nUltimately, there would be mono¬\nlithic control of a vast means of\neducating the American people. The\npossibilities are endless.\nFinally, there is no need for Fed¬\neral subsidies. Private institutions, in¬\ncluding foundations, have the money\nand the willingness to help local agen¬\ncies make use of these channels.\nNo one questions the immense ad¬\nvantage of using radio and television\nin education. One gifted teacher could\nsupplement the efforts of hundreds of\naverage classroom instructors. But the\nchannels available should be allocated\nwithout discrimination, without Fed¬\neral subsidies, and with no possibility\nof monolithic control. Control of edu¬\ncational facilities should remain where\nit is, at the state and local level.\nNewsweek, January 29, 1962"
