  "text": "FOREWORD\nThis new NAEB Directory has been designed to make it easier for you to keep\nit up to date. You will notice that it is punched for a loose-leaf binder\nand that there is extra space left on each sheet. Each month, in the Newsletter,\nwe will publish any changes in membership (or in addresses, phone numbers, person¬\nnel, etc.) that have occurred during the preceding month. This will permit\nyou to make the necessary changes in your copy of the Directory. Periodically\nnew sheets will be issued, incorporating the changes published in the Newsletter,\nand these can be readily substituted for the out-dated sheet in your loose-leaf\nDirectory. We believe this new system will allow you to keep your Directory\ncurrent and will alleviate the necessity of printing complete new Directories as\noften as has been done in the past. YOUR COOPERATION IN HELPING US KEEP THE\nDIRECTORY UP TO DATE WILL BE APPRECIATED — PLEASE SEND IN ANY CHANGES AS SOON\nAS THEY OCCUR.\nThis new Directory has been devised to give you more information about the\nNAEB membership, and, by referring to the Index below, you should be able to\nuse it more efficiently than in the past.\nSummary of Membership & Analysis of Active Membership 1\nOfficers, Directors, Consultants and Staff 2\nStates in NAEB Regions 3\nActive Members (Alphabetically by States) (Blue paper) 4\nAssociate Members (Alphabetically by States) (Pink paper) 23\nAffiliate Members (Alphabetically by States) (Green paper) 36\nAlphabetical Listing of Radio Stations (By Call Letters) 48\nAlphabetical Listing of TV Stations (By Call Letters) 53\nHonorary Members 54\nNOTE: (#) An asterisk following the call letters indicates that the station\nsubscribes to the NAEB Radio Network service."
