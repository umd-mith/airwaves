And though he is at one with the\npulsations of the universe... he does have this rather distracting\ntic in his left cheek.. dower quadrant.\nBetter to get an actor, perhaps.\nThe \"authority\" is replaced with an \"authority surrogate.\" Suave, handsome, finished,\nsmooth. A bit of \"dash\" in the performance.\nTELEVISION:\nA performer of artistry and presence. A quick study who can\nmaster the lingo and the tricks of the trade.. .who can grip the\nlectern with authority.. .handle the graphics with a professional\nflourish.. .move with ease and style.. .speak with precision and\npace.\nBut this presenter has his drawbacks, too.. .as you can tell from\na quick look at the front row. •.\nWe cut quickly to two viewers.. .wtaching the screen."
