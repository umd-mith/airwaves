You have treated in a wise and kindly\nmanner the big problem that I suspect will exist in all efforts\nof American educational broadcasters to help in the newly dev¬\neloping countries. It serves as sort of a warning and at the\nsame time, an encouragement, to any who might contemplate such\nan assignment.\nThanks very much for writing it. X will use it in a near-future\nissue.\nBest regards.\n(Mrs.) 1\nPublications Editor\n8MCK/mp\nblcc: Harold E. Hill ^\nWalter B. Emery\nI"
