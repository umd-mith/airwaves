  "text": "Under “Types of Projects Desired\" you state: \"Programs produced under the project\nneed not necessarily ha in the form of drama9 hut may he in any field or of any type\ngenerally accepted as being good educational radio or television©\" I think you em¬\nphasise the wrong thing here; this suggests that drama is DgefgrrM* which I donH\nthink you mean© Perhaps it would he better to phrase it this way: \"Programs produced\nunder the project may be cast in any form sppropriat^to their content©\"\nI think there should be some clarification of the second paragraph under '’Details\nof the Grants\" — in which you state that money cannot be used for capital equipment\nalthough \"any devices needed specifically for the accomplishment of a project may b©\nallowed\"© This needs further explanation*, how do we differentiate between \"capital\nequipment\" and a \"device\"?\nIn the third paragraph on page two you state: \"In the case of projects in the\nfield of television* it shall be the duty and responsibility of the production center\nto furnish to NAEB kinescope recordings or duplicating negatives of all programs pro¬\nduced by the project©\" This I think should be qualified by some such term as \"if\npossible\"* or \"if kinescope recording equipment is available\"© At present there are\nfew if any kinescoping facilities in regular use anywhere except in New York* Chicago*\nHollywood* Ames* and East Lansing© Therefore, an absolute requirement that all tele¬\nvision projects be recorded would have the effect of excluding entries from any except\nthose places named* and I am sure that is not our intention©\nThe following paragraph states: \"It shall be the duty and responsibility of the\nproduction center to clear all production rights of programs produced under the terms\nof these grants-in-aid for subsequent use by educational radio and TV production\ncenters©\" Here, tco* I would suggest a phrase like \"if possible\", or something of that\nsort, since some types of musical and dramatic productions might be excluded if wide¬\nspread re-broadcast rights were an absolute requirement©\nIn the section entitled* \"How To Apply For Grants\" you state: \"Program series\nneed not be completely written or produced before the application 1b made©\" I think\nthis statement should be eliminated since it implies that the series in question should\nbe at least partly written or produced before application is made© Realistically* a\nproject involving the expenditure of several thousand dollars could not even be begun\nunless the money were available©\nLet me repeat, John* that I think you have stated the situation very well.\nsuggestions, although rather extensive, are directed towards details rather than\nfundamental matters©\nOnce this is all ironed out* I suggest you send me immediately the information\nyou would like to be sent to all members through the News-Letter© Since I shall hold\nthe July News-Letter until I get this from you* I hope I shall be receiving it rather\nshortly.\nWith best personal regards,\nYours sincerely,\nEurton Paulu\nSecretary and Publications Editor\nce: NAEB Board of Directors\nEd.
