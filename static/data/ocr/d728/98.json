The\nbox fully loaded weighs about 700 pounds. Pictures showing steps for erecting will\nbe included with the exhibit* It is estimated that it should take two men an hour\nor two to put it up* Lighting for the exhibit is self-contained, but a 115 watt AC\noutlet should be available* A black-and-white picture of the exhibit is enclosed*\nThe exhibit is, of course, very colorful* It was built for us by the University of\nIllinois at a cost of over $1200*\nThe promotion budget for the Adult Education Project is very limited. It will be\nnecessary for member stations to pay a portion of the total promotion costs* This\nseems to be the ideal place for local participation* Hence, the following conditions\nwill be necessary for your use of the exhibit:\n(1) The exhibit will be delivered by Railway Express to your point of erection*\n(2) The erection, space rental, power, and other local costs must be borne by you*\n(3) Shipping charges to the next point of display must be prepaid by you*\nWe will make up a schedule for this exhibit much as we do for programs on the tape\nnetwork* We will make every effort to keep shipping distances at a minimum. In\nchecking with the local Railway Express office, we have determined that if we can\nkeep the shipping distances between 200 and 300 miles, the express costs will be\nabout $25. We believe that even if you have to pay for all of the erection and\npacking costs, this bill should also not exceed $25. Heuce, the t»t«2 cost to you\nto show this exhibit for a week would be around $50* We sincerely believe that this\nexhibit will attract a great deal of attention to your station and to the fine\nshows offered by NAEB, with particular emphasis on the excellent shows produced\nunder the Fund for Adult Education grant by the NAEB Adult Education Project*\nI can*t urge too strongly that you investigate the possibility of a prominent dis~\nplay place and that you accept this offer without delay* I am sure it will cause\nas many favorable comments as it did for NAEB generally at the UNESCO meeting*\nPlease do fill in the attached form and mail it to us at once*\nSincerely,\nExecutive Director\nP* S* The exhibit will be on display at the IER-T meeting in Columbus, May 17-20*"
