Skornia, Radio Officer\nAmerican Embassy\nAPO 777, o/o Postmaster\nRev York, Hew York\nDear Harry s\nConfirming our telephone conversation of last week, we would be most happy to have\nyou here as the director of this project starting whenever you can after Hay 1 and\ndefinitely by June 1* I will just try to go down and give some random answers to\nquestions I might ask if I were in your position.\n(1) Relationships with the Kellogg people have been excellent. Earlier there were\nsome feelings that with the FAE grants being so much larger that they would over¬\nshadow the Kellogg contribution. However, we have managed to convince the Kellogg\npeople that their grant was actually the key grant and that without it there could\nhave been but little use made of the Ford money.\n(2) The grant was for five years. It calls for #245,OCX) over the five years, this\nbeing fairly equally divided between the so-called project and the tape network.\nTape network contributions in the form of service assessment fees from members were\nto take on an ever-increasing proportion of the cost of maintaining the network. At\nBiloxi in November of 1951, the members voted to more than make up the necessary\none-quarter for the fiscal year 1952-53. In addition, they voted to make a backlog\nby assessing themselves for one-half this first year^ fee from January 1 to July 1,\n1952. At the Minneapolis meeting just past, they voted the 1953-54 service assessment\nfees, which are exactly double the 1952-53 fees. I have talked to many members, both\nbig and small, and the service assessment fees do not worry them. I believe we can\nmaintain the network at at least sixty and perhaps seventy members even after we\nare carrying the entire burden.\nThe other portion of the budget is #34,000 per year for the entire five-year period.\nThis is intended to finance the central office and some meetings, seminars, research,\nprinting, etc. In the past, this has been used to hold the Allerton seminar for\nschool stations, to hold the regional meeting at Norman, Oklahoma, to help hold the\nIowa State College TP Workshop this past summer, and to finance innumberable meetings\nof the Board and the Executive Committee. I believe use for this latter purpose\nwill be greatly reduced In future years — in fact, we have only paid for one\nExecutive Committee meeting out of Kellogg funds since last Hay."
