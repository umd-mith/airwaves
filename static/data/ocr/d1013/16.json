These features are seen as: — one rich\nfair land offering vast opportunities; one diverse people melded\ninto a national unit; one background of knowledge and skills,\ninherited from the mass races of our ancestry and lastly, the new,\ntireless and universal ideas of a new land.\nEor the first time in America we have been able\nto harness the intelligence of noted scholars in the production of\na series of radio programs. \"The Jeffersonian Heritage\" is based\non the research, writings and advice of Professor Dumas Malone of\nthe Department of History of Columbia University, and stars Mr.\nClaude Rains as Thomas Jefferson.\nI hope there is some manner in which you will be\nable to hear some of these programs on the educational radio station\nin your community. Your comments on this type of adult, mature and\nliterate radio broadcasting would be .sincerely appreciated.\nPRESIDENT\nSEYMOUR N.
