They are true emotions, because\nthey have come from a realistic stimulation***the documents were recorded\non the spot**•as they happened* They are the direct result of an\nearnest attempt to present both the good he bad, the simple and th©\ndifficult, the humorous and the serious p of each phase of Air Force\nTraining*\nEach program in the series is complete within itself, and its\nprogramming can ba planned independently of any others* If some\nstation should riot desire to broadcast the complete series of thirteen\nprograms, those that they do choose can be broadcast without any loss\nof continuity*\nThe series was prepared by the Oral Productions Section of the\nOffice of Information Services for the Air Training Command* The\nproduction was under the direst supervision of Mr, Russell Wagner, the\nchief of the section, with aid and assistance from skilled radio tech¬\nnicians recruited from installations throughout the Command* The\nquality of the series is something that cannot be described adequately"
