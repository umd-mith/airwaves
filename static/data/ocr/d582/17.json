A parish priest committed\nthe “unthinkable crime\" of telling the\nlocal peasants to provide for their fam¬\nilies rations before meeting the ob¬\nligatory State delivery quotas. He was\nsentenced to 19 months’ hard labor and\na heavy fine.\n• A 25 year old law student named Ivan\nPluhar escaped last fall from Czecho¬\nslovakia’s notorious Jachymov uranium\nmines. His story of brutality and torture\nwith “electric slippers,” the “steel head-\nband” and worse depicts a hell on earth.\n• The Boy Scouts in Poland are told to\nhonor Pavlik Morozov as a “Soviet\nhero.” Why? Because Morozov de¬\nnounced his parents to the secret police\nfor hiding grain. They were arrested and\ndeported.\n• On July 20, 1951, a Hungarian mother\nand her 4 year old son, Karoly, reported\nfor a medical check-up at the Rakosi\nState Kindergarten. On arrival, she was\ntold that she had been selected as a\n“volunteer” for a labor battalion and\nthat she would have to “transfer” her\nson to State care. She was then given\n3000 forints (about $60) and told to sign\na receipt “renouncing all rights” to her\nchild. A few weeks later she threw her¬\nself before an oncoming train.\nThese are true examples of what Communism in\npractice means. They provide the most eloquent rea¬\nson why the National Committee for a Free Europe\nwas formed.\nThe Committee began work in 1949, when a group\nof private citizens joined together for positive action\nagainst Soviet enslavement. It concentrates its efforts\non the 100 million Central and Eastern Europeans"
