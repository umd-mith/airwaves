By virtue of their numbers alone\nthey constitute a rich resource for the\nrest of the world. Their capacity for\ngrowth is enormous. Their capacity to\ncontribute either destructively or con¬\nstructively cannot yet be even dimly\nperceived. Their capacity to cooperate\non world problems will, l am positive,\nbe stupendous.\nuTherefore, in the particular and of\ncourse unique period in history in\nwhich I live and in which l contem¬\nplate the probable history of my nation\nand the world, 1 am more inclined than\nl would have been at any previous time\nin history to build bridges of under¬\nstanding between America and Asia. I\nnever forget that in this interchange\nAmerica is in a strong position to give\nAsia much; but the longer l live in Asia\nthe more convinced l am that this great\ncontinent can also give us much.”\n-James A. Michener"
