Holt, Ausmus\n/\nMay 26, 1934\nMiss Gloria Dapper\nNational Citizens Commission\nfor the Public Schools\n2 West 45 Street\nNew York 36, N.Y.\nDear Gloria:\n1 was delighted to get your note of May 17. All of us\nappreciate your kind words concerning the new television\nstation.\nInsofar as \"Doorway to the Future\" is concerned, I think the\nNAEB would be interested in considering the series for\ndistribution. Why not drop a note to Mr. John Holt, the Network\nManager of the NAEB at 119 Gregory Hall, University of\nIllinois, Urbana, Illinois. You might also send him sample\ntapes. The program proposal and the audition t%pss will be\nsubmitted to the 66 flnQCccoptaaco Committee\nbefore a formal offering is made to the member stations of the\nNetwork. If you supply a master series of tapes, the Network\nmakes the necessary duplicate copies for distribution to the\nmember stations. After some idea of the acceptance of the\nprograms is obtained 1 think that Mr. Holt might be able to let\nyrnaw know how the Commission can assist in the promotion\nand audience-building activities which the series deserves.\nI would love to take lunch with you some time in the next week or\nso. At that time we might also be able to discuss the Commission's\nparticipation in NAEB’s 30th Convention which takes place in New\nYork, October 27 to 30 .\nWith all host wishoe, beliove me,\nCordially yours,\nshe -Ig"
