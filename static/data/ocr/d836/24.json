As\nyou will see from the various items attached, the FAB has recently\ngranted the KAES funds with which to consolidate Personnel-Placement\nefforts for educational television and radio. The letter from Mr. Griffiths\nto Hr* Mullen (dittoed copy attached) explains this clearly, I believe.\nIn a few days you will be receiving front our Mr. Don Walker, who is in\ncharge of this service for us, and whoa you may contact directly, ques¬\ntionnaires to enable us to help you.\nMeanwhile, the entire Mew Jersey staff is available as will\nbe noted from the attached. This is the best source of personnel (of the\nsort I think you noed) that I know of at the moment, though I am asking\nMr. Walker to scrutinise all files as they come in, and try to help you\nfind the beet poseihle candidates.\nIncidentally may we circularise this position to prospective\ncandidates? Within the next few weeks Mr. Walker hopes to have job\nanalyses and descriptions available which will give us s batter answer\nthan we now have to the statement of desirable qualifications for managers\nand other positions. I shall see that you have the best thinking avail¬\nable on this as soon as it ic avail able. A recent article in the ABET\nJournal, by Dr. Walter Emery, will be enclosed with this letter if we\nstill have s copy available. Otherwise a copy can be secured direct\nfrom Dr. Emery at the JC8T address in Washington."
