(Too many requests for services). Also\nfeel that psychologically Walker cou3.d do little with a Waghingtch\ntrip except run into frustrations. We therefore are agaiijWfcart at\nscratch, which has meant a considerable waste of Walker’s time so\nfar. However, we’re prepared to do what we can.\nSo far received frpr. Mrs. Kelly several months ago was a short capsule\nmention for pur NfeWS.Iott.erf of a few candidates, whose files were not\nsent or dipped into too deeply.\nWill try to keep on top of everything, I imagine you are as busy\nas we are-*.-which is mighty busy.\n1 t\nSincerely,\nI\nHarry Skomla\nExecutive Director\nHJSsmbh\nShe: Ditto\nOOP?\nh\n\\\n/;/"
