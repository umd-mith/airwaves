Most of them have filled out the form\nMary sent them, so rate as currently available, at least so\nfar as we know. One point that I felt your people and Mary might\ndiscuss is how you propose to keep them current.\nShe also raises the question as to how we should\nhandle the letters that come in from time to time asking about\nopportunities;. In the past she has simply mailed them a form.\nWould you like for her to continue that, or to simply acknow¬\nledge the letter and then forward it to you?\nAs I mentioned tc you before, we have people drop\nin from time to time and she has handled them in the same way,\nthat is, had them fill out the form. I think we will probably\n^ continue to do this if for no other reason than to sa/e the time\nof our other people who otherwise would have to sit and listen\nto the pitches. But we will tell tbu m, at the same time, to get\nin touch with you and to send their papers to you.\nAs you can see from examining the file, we have\nnever really been in the personnel business, but were limply\ntrying to pull the pieces together and treat people who con¬\ntacted us in an orderly way until such time as you were in\nposition to run recruitment programs, training schools and\nall the things that are needed. We will look to you for real\nservice.\nSo, good luck and please be assured again that we\nwill cooperate with you in every way possible to make a success\nof the venture. Let us know what we can do.\nCordially,\nRobert R. Mullen\nExecutive Director"
