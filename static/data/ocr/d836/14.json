Griffiths\nFund For Adult Education\n1444 Wentworth Avenue\nPasadena 5, California\nDear Bills\nThanks for your letter of April 8\nabout NAE8 placement service. I had a note\na week or so ago from Skornia, and one of\nhis people, and of course was delighted to\nlearn they were going to be set for opera-\ntions soon. I suggested that they have their\nman come down here some time after May 1, or\nwhenever convenient for them, so that we can\ngive them whatever we have that they need.\nActually, 1 believe there has been some ex¬\nchange of names, etc. between Skornia and\nour Mrs. Kelly in the past so, as far as I\nknow, no great problems loom ahead.\nI feel it will be important to set\nup some regular system for referral of in¬\nquiries, fo1 low-through, etc., but no doubt\nthe people working at the particular tasks\ncan come up with a proper routine.\nCordial ly.\ncc Harry Skornia\nRobert R. Mullen\nExecutive Director"
