  "text": "Mr# Harold-Hill\nAugust 8, I960\nAnother source of funds might be from electronics manufacturers such as RCA,\nWestinghouse, General Electric, ect., who supply equipment for educational\nstations#\nIn regard to Mr# Sulzer*s letter, of July 20, on the project, I agree that the\nmultitude of national weeks are all too prevalent in every category, but I still\nfeel that such a week has merit and with the full support of member stations\nputting their collective best foot forward, in a strong appeal to the public,\nthe intent and purpose of educational television and radio would be enhanced.\nIt seems, from the correspondence I have received, that many people in NETRC\nand NAEB have been toying with the idea of such a week for two or three years\nbut no real research into the validity of such a project has been conducted.\nI suggest that a committee be delegated to check into the feasibility of such\nan idea, to contact ETV&R members for their reactions, and suggestions, and\ninvestigate the costs and time involved in such an undertaking.\nIf the idea proves good, I suggest following through on it. If not, shelve\nit.\nI agree that there are a lot of problems involved in such an undertaking, and\nhope this letter proves of some possible help#\nLeslie F. Harcus\nProducer-Director\nLFH/jb\ncc: Mr. Elmer G. Sulzer\nMr. Bernard F. Kamins\nMir. Nazaret Cherkezian"
