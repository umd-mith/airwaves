  "text": "-2-\nKa^ins\n12 April, I960\nThe NAEB image is painted by the deeds, character\nand expressed thoughts of your President. He is the\nsymbol that gives the public your image.\nV/hat I am leading up to is that your President\nshould be publicized to the high heaven. In that way,\nyour image will be made concrete and easy to handle.\nA President is a living, human being, and is dynamic\njust as an image h s to be fluid. As the President\nchanges, so doth the organization.\n2) If nobody has volunteered yet to give you\nthe development of a check list of promotion routines\nfor educational stations, I would be willing to boil\ndown ten principles for publicizing a station, anc\nsend it to you for your changes and corrections and\ndeletions and additions, ^ou then could send the\nresult of your machinations to the next public relations\ncommittee member and let him do a job on it. Thus, the\n]bMn<ritp]Les could pass from hand to hand until your comm¬\nittee agrees on them. Ten easy principles could be\neasily printed on one small card and these cards passed\nout like the Ten Commandments. So I volunteer if nobody\nyet has.\n3) Out of my line.\n4) Not necessary.\n5) Not necessary.\n6) List the broadcasting publications in which\nyou would like your publicity to appear. List the\neducational publications in which you wish your publi¬\ncity to appear. Send a Fact Sheet about the NAEB geared\nto the broadcasting magazines, to these editors, and ask\nthem whether or not they would like more information on\nany particular phase mentioned in the Kact Sheet. Bo\nthe same with the editors of the educational publications.\nThe resultant communications will provide you with enough\nwork and with enough guidance for articles.\nSuccess stories are no good. These are like a\nsmall boy boasting and impair the object you are trying\nto preserve (so Burke once said in his \"Speech on Conciliation”"
