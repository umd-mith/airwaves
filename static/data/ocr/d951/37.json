Such variables\ninclude dimensions of publication, folding or/and stapling methods, number of\ncolors used, type of fold, amount of copy, quantity of cuts, and number of copies\nprinted or otherwise duplicated.\nAs an alternate, some typical and extreme figures are given, which may prove\nof some value. Of the Class I stations publishing printed programs, the size of\neditions ranged a low of 500 costing $75 to a high of 25,000, cost not given.\nA sampling of the returns of the respondents is presented below:\nSize of Edition\n500\n700\n900\n1,300\n6,000\n9,000\n9,000\n12,200\n25,000\nPrinting Cost\n$ 75\n$ no\n$ 100\n$ 110\n$ 100 - $ 126\n$ 150\n$ 300 - $ 400\n$ 250\nno price given\nThe cost of the \"processed” programs by the Class I stations runs very much\nless, as indicated by the following compilation of typical returns:\nSize of Edition\nPrinting Cost\n100\n\"negligible\"\n500\n$ 50\n2,000\n$ 35\n2,000\n$ 40 (including postage)\n2,000\n$ 42\n2,000\n$ 60 (including postage)"
