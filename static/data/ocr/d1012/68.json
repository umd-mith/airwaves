As Narrator speaks, camera moves generally around\nthe group. . .then, cued by the narration, from the face of one student to another.\nNARRATOR: We face the learners!\nThe large minds and the small. . .the closed minds and\nthe open. . .the quick of wit. . .the slow of pace. . .those\nwho soar and those who crawl and those who ignite fitfully\nwith a small, hot flame.\nWe face the self-starters. . .the gliders. . .the jet-propelled\n. . .with their capacities as personalized as their cowlicks. .\ntheir needs as varied as their noses.\nWe see them clearly. We contemplate them separately.\nCamera now begins to pick up individual students, close up, one at a time.\nNARRATOR: Whatever this boy learns, he must learn for himself.\nNobody can learn for him.\nThis girl must learn at her own rate.\nThis girl at hers.\nThis girl at hers. They are not the same.\nThis boy learns more when each step in his learning is\nreinforced without delay.\nThis girl's total learning is more meaningful if she has\nmastered each step along the way."
