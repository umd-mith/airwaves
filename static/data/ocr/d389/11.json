We also received from Mr. Heslep\na copy of the letter which he wrote to you. This is an attempt\nto let you know what we are doing about the series.\nI have contacted WLS asking them to send copies of the\nprograms to us for duplication. Meanwhile, I will make a list\nof all the stations interested in carrying the series which I\nwill forward to AFRA headquarters hoping that they will then\ngive us appropriate clearances. Once all of this has been done\nas nearly as I can tell, we will be clear to send the programs ,\nout on the network.\nIt if is agreeable with you, I should like to make a\nproposal concerning the stations wfjto would be interested in\ndubbing copies of the program for use beyond a single broadcast\nof a series. I will mention in my letter to AFRA that some of\nthe stations probably would be interested in doing this. Particu¬\nlarly the school stations would be interested. Vie do not yet\nhave any kind of facilities for operating a library service. We\nhope to have some day. If such use is agreeable to AFRA, there\napparently will be no problem involved. If they are hesitant to\ngrant such a clearance, additional action would seem to be\nindicated. I thought maybe you would have some ideas on this\nphase of the problem.\nHoping that this makes some sense and looking forward\nto continued cooperation with your office, I am,\nCordially yours,\nRichard L. Rider\nManager\nNAEB TAPE NETWORK\nRLR:bgm"
