As you know, WLS and Mr. Snyder have\ngenerously allowed the NAEB to offer this program to its member\nstations pending approval by the unions.\nWe are in receipt of letters from Mr. Heslep of the\nAtomic Energy Commission and the unions. The musician1s union\nhas given blanket clearances. AFRA wants more specific informa¬\ntion, but it seems certain that they will grant the clearance\nwhen we send them the list of stations that will carry the\nprograms. Therefore, I will inventory our stations and send\na list of same to AFRA headquarters, on the assumption that they\nwill grant the necessary clearances.\nMeanwhile, if you would be so kind as to send the copies\nto us, we can begin to make copies and get them ready for dis¬\ntribution. When we have done this, we will return your copies.\nBe assured that we will not issue the program until written\nclearances are obtained from AFRA.\nThank you for your trouble and may I again extend our\ndeepest gratitude to WLS for making this series available to us.\nWith warmest regards,\nCordially,\nRichard L.
