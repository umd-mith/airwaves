I will take an inventory of our member\nstations and send a complete list of those that will carry the\nprograms to AFRA headquarters# I gather from their letter that\nthey will then give us clearances. Naturally, I will do this\nbefore the programs are sent out*\nI am also writing Mrs. Broderick so that she will know\nexactly what we are doing.\nAgain on behalf of NAEB, my thanks. ¥ith warmest regards,\nCordially yours,\nRichard L.
