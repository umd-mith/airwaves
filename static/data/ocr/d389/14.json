Frank Reel\nNational Executive Secretary\nAmerican Federation of Radio Artists\n15 West 44th Street\nNew York, 18, New York\nDear Mr. Reel:\nI am in receipt of a copy of your letter to Mr. Charter\nHeslep of the United States Atomic Energy Commission regarding\nthe use of the series of programs on atomic energy which were\ndone by Station Y/L3 in Chicago.\nAttached you will find a list of the stations affiliated\nwith the NAEB which are interested in broadcasting these programs.\nA second list of stations indicates those which do nin-schoolw\nbroadcasting and are therefore interested in having permission\nto keep copies of the programs on hand for reuse. As you are\nno doubt aware in the case of school broadcasting, it is well\nnigh impossible to get all classes to listen at any one time.\nThus necessitating the rebroadcast of each program several times.\nThe majority of stations are interested in permission\nto use the series as single broadcasts. Only those indicated\nare interested in keeping a copy for additional use. V*e sincerely\nhope that you will give your earnest consideration to this request.\nIf your approval is secured, we will make up a schedule of\nstations and the dates on which they will eventually use these\nprograms. If you are interested, we would be happy to send you\na copy of this final schedule.\nThank you for your splendid cooperation.\nCordially yours,\nRichard L. Rider\nManager\nNAEB Tape Network\nRLR:bgm"
