Rider\nRational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois\n119 Gregory Hall\nUr bans. * Illinois\nDear Mr. Rider:\nIn reply to your letter of March 20th, this will constitute\npermission for all of the stations which you have listed in\nyour letter with the exception of 7JRYG, to receive off-the-\nline recordings of'the* atomic energy Series done by WIS in\nChicago for one broadcast of each program.\nThis does not permit the second list of stations keeping copies\nfor additional use. If you can work out some arrangement with\nthose stations whereby the copies vri.ll be returned to you after\nthey have had their in-school use, we will grant such permission,\nbut we do not wish to allow' these copies to be kept by the sta¬\ntions or schools.\nThe reason for our making an exception of INTO is because altho*\nwe realize this is a non-commercial station, it is a station with\nwhich we h$ve had considerable difficulty. This station employs\nstaff announcers who are members of AFRA. It pays them miserably\nlow wages. Because they are municipal employees, our ordinary\neconomic weapon is not available to us. Consequently, we have\nbeen forced to take the position that we can in no way aid this\nstation to obtain programming of any sort unless and until it\ntakes steps to alleviate the deplorable conditions that exist with\nrespect to the announcing staff*\nSincerely,\nAMERICAN FEDERATION OF RADIO ARTISTS\nA. FRANK REEL\nNATIONAL EXECUTIVE SECRETARY\nAFR:h"
