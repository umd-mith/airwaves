NcCabe Day, WVSH\nJanuary 4, 1954\nwe.e I +.Mwfr your plan is certainly meant to solve the problem of distribution\nso that there will be no last-minute delivery of tapes* The only difficulty may be\nin the matter of working so far ahead in selection that we lose contact with\nusers, in that we cannot make selections on the basis of reported neet’s, except\npossibly two years hence* I relize that on© \"can8t have his cake and eat it, too,**\nso we shall have to sacrifice some immediacy in the response of the committee\nto the necessity of getting out tapes in advance of use, and still not upset\nthe headquarters operations by bunching a mass of duplicating all at one time.\nIf the time of selection did not have to be in April, 19549 for the year 1955-56,\nit would be desirable, but that would mean slitting up an audition session at some\ntime other than the regular meetings. Of course, I think this would be the most\ndesirable procedure, even though all of us cn th© committee are busy enough\nwithout having additional meetings; but thin possibility would depend upon head¬\nquarters policy in regard to committee meetings?.ao"
