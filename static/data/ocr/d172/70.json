She creates excellent word-pictures by malting the most\nof word sounds be it \"squishy,\" \"slushy,” \"puddle,\" or \"Stopi \" She uses\na lot of poetry| and most of it is there and gone without being obvious\nwhich to mind is the way poetry should be presented. Even some of her\nstories utilize lots of rhyme and rhythm.\n\"Her explanations are simple, yet very effective—she has for example^\na beautiful explanation of an island, which any small child can understand.\nIn some things, the Xistemer can actually par -iclpate—simple action®\nthat don8t require much material, maybe pencil and paper or merely the rug\non the floor* When she says, \"Let5s pretend this or that,..1*, it is\nvery effective, because she is careful about using lots of detail to\nbuild up pictures.\n\"Her use of music and sound is extremely effective, too. There is a\nnice amont of music that is highly descriptive, i„e. , a rippling piano\npieco for water; some wonderful \"walking\" music. Much of the music ia\nrepeated effectively. There is a musical sound used for a star, that is\nrepeated often enough that soon the music by itself stands for a star\ntwinkling—with no words necessary. There is & nice mood about the whole\nshow* **\nMarg Walton\nWILL\nWriter of StoMes *n Stuff\nA list of programs and more promotion will follow as scon as it Is\nreceived at headquarters,"
