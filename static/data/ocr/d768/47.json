It will be necessary for us\nto rry . th ■ Jen .. :r ,'\npromised Kellogg in exchange for funds granted us in our regular\nbudget, and we must also give one regional conference in the east*\nbeyond the on© already held in Region VI. This has greatly re¬\nduced the number of items on which m can affect a saving, to\neliminate a great deficit this year. The fact that part of this\ndeficit is due to earlier years, is academic, and does not help\nthe present situation.\nThe only alternative is to sharply reduce, and practically elimi¬\nnate all further purchases. If personnel leaves or goes on part-\ntime, these persons will not;be replaced. I myself have agreed\nto do some teaching, reimbursement for which will be paid not to\nme as I had originally Intended, but to the IAEB in order to help\nus get through the year. Tills will mean that for two hours a\nmek I will not be in -the office. In order to get my other work\ndone, I shall probably also havs to find © more private place to\nwork a few hours a week where X can work uninterruptedly. %\ncourse preparation, etc., will be carried on at night.\nI ask full cooperation and understanding. Pleas© let m have any\nideas you may have for savings which can b® affected end pleas©\nexcuse me if I turn down virtually ©12, requisitions, and carefully,\nscrutinise ©very expenditure.\nI will ask for a reexamination of tap© network dubbing and de¬\nlivery load, so that not only dubbing trim©, but also postage\nfor shipf&ents;may be reduced as much as possible. Requests for\nspecial services and special orders will, have to be declined as\npolitely a® possible*\nPlease sign this sheet and return to me with any oosaaents you\nmy have."
