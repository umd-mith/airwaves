He is retiring this year after 30 years\nof service, to devote all of his energies to the work of the\nFreundschaftsheim, the Friendship Home, which he established in his\nneighborhood for young people “of all nations, races and creeds to\nwork together for human brotherhood and peace.\"\nThe Voices of Europe series will be presented on WMAQ under the\nsupervision of Miss Judith Waller, director of public affairs and\neducation of the NBC Central Division,\nMiss Waller states: “We are very pleased to be able to present\nthis group of firsthand recorded reports from the western side of\nEurope’s Iron Curtain. Milton Mayer is a distinguished authority on\nthe European scene, and the interviews he has brought back give a very\nhuman and personalized picture of present-day Europe.\n’’Listeners must be warned, however,\" Miss Waller adds, \"that most\nof the interviewees are speaking in a language other than their native\none, and that the recordings are necessarily slow-moving. The content\nof their messages will more than reward the attentive listening\ndemanded.\"\nTWO NBC “UNCLES” IN PARADE\nProminent in the August 16 parade in Morton Grove, Ill., sponsored\nby the Chamber of Commerce, will be Johnny Coons, WNBQ’s \"Uncle\nJohnny,\" and Norbert Locke, \"Uncle Ned\" of WMAQ’s Uncle Ned's Squadron.\nJohnny will be up to his usual antics, while \"Uncle Ned\" will\nsail gliders from the open convertible in which he will be riding.\n(8753)"
