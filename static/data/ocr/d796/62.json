Hill\nDATE: April 17, 1962\nThe NAEB Constitution committee has been considering, at the request of the\nstaff, four amendments to the Constitution and/or By-Laws.\nYou«11 recall that, at the time of the Board meeting here last October, the\nBoard felt that terms of Board members should be limited to two full terms\nin succession. They also felt that, now that Headquarters is located in\nWashington, the convention rotation provided for in the By-Laws should be\nlatered to provide for periodic conventions in Washington - perhaps every\nfour or five years. These two matters were referred to the Constitution\ncommittee.\nIn addition, two other amendments were considered. One would permit the\nAdministrative Vice President to serve as official Treasurer of the Association,\nand the other would expand our purposes to include mention of direct instruction.\nThe Constitution committee has approved of all four of these amendments and\nthey should now be voted on by the Board at the meeting in Columbus. Therefore,\nI have attached the background information for your consideration - my original\nmemos to the committee and Chairman Walter Emery8 s memo to the committee\nspelling out the specific amendments (which the cominittee has subseouently\napproved)•\nIf the Board approves of these amendments, they will then be submitted to\nthe membership, by mail, for their vote as provided for in the Constitution\nand By-Laws. The vehicle to be used to notify the membership will probably\nbe the Newsletter since we now attempt to use this as the official method for\ntransmittal of important items to the membership*\nPLEASE BRING THIS MATERIAL TO THE BOARD MEETING WITH YOU.\nHEH:abt\ncc: Leonard Marks"
