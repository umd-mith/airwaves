Other bases of experimentation and demon¬\nstration can be made available through members of the NAEB and various experimental\nschools and laboratories in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe gratifying recognition by virtually all with whom this has been discussed that it is basic\nto an intelligent development of valid courses 0 valid utilization and inter-course\nmaterials, assures us of the full cooperation of as many cooperating educational institu¬\ntions as will be needed.\nA great deal of actual demonstration with children would also be involved; to test what\nTV and radio do to the viewer and listener in specific affective areas; to identify and\nmeasure differences in reactions in the consuming of materials transmitted by the\nteacher in person, the book, the film, radio and television, and through other channels,\nwith empaasis always on identifying and maximizing the usefulness and peculiarities of\nthe new media, against a background of, and integrated with , the older media.\nVIII. Duration: The project proposed would require two years, with periodic publication\nof interim results.\nThe first year would be devoted principally to experimentation, demonstration, consultation\nand evaluation. The secondyear would be devoted largely to verification of results and\npreparation of the finished results in publishable form"
