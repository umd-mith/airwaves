Your memo to the new\nDirectors concerned (except that Sehenkkan is in Region\nV, but I presume Texas is involved in the Conference anyway)\nwas a fine idea, and I’m glad to see that you’ve talked to\nJohn Witherspoon and that things are progressing well.\nSo far as I know now, Bill Harley is planning to attend the\nConference, and from the work you’ve done I believe the NAEB\nmembers in the Region should be well informed about it...so\nit should turn out very well.\nI expect to have an opportunity to chat with John about the\nRegional meeting at the time of our Radio Division Board\nmeeting in Chicago on January 29th.\nThanks again for your fine cooperation and help.\nCordially,\nHarold E. Hill\nHEH/mlm\ncc: John Witherspoon"
