Hill\nPage 2\nJanuary 27, 1965\nIt seems to me that the evening session on Thursday and the section\nmeetings on Friday should be organized in such a way as to be of the\nmost advantage for the NAEB. I will play any role that you wish in the\norganization but basically it would seem to be in the hands of the\nregional directors and your office*\nI have a personal feeling that the Thursday evening meeting should\nbe started with a real good \"kick-off\" speech, sort of a vice presidential\nreport to Region VI and then some of the others perhaps of the regional\ngroups could very well be bn the panel and those on the floor participate\nin the question and answer period. But the real meat of the evening\ncould be in a presentation with which the session is begun.\nAfter having heard Dr* Arthur S. Flemming and the keynote address\non Wednesday night devoted to this changing society of ours, you might\nwant to spend some of your time responding with the responsibilities\nthat you see educational broadcasters and the NAEB possessing as they\nmeet the challenges of the changing times* Ralph Steetle has put it\nrather well when he said, \"If this conference helps broadcasters to\nhelp people meet these changes as opportunities rather than as crisis,\nthe WRTC of 1965 will have been a success.\" Your regional meeting may\nwish to look at the challenges of these times of change* All of the\ngeneral sessions of the conference will be devoted to this approach.\nWe look forward to your being with us and anticipate interesting\ntimes.\nSincerely yours.\nforties M. Morris, Head\n^formation Services"
