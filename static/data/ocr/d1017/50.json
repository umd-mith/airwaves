Morris\nAssistant to the Director\nDepartment of Educational Media\nOregon State System of Higher Education\n219 Coliseum\nCorvalifts, Oregon\nDear Jimmie:\nHaving heard nothing from you recently regarding the forth¬\ncoming Region VI meeting at WRTC, 1 presume all plans are\nproceeding apace. Unfortunately, finances will permit only\none of us to attend the meeting, and since I have to come to\nPortland anyway in the near future to \"examine\" it as a poten¬\ntial 1967 NAEB convention site, I have been tapped.\nI am delighted with this opportunity, and will be willing to\nparticipate in any way you desire. I presume my participation\nwill probably be during the Thursday evening session since the\nFriday morning session has been set aside for each NAEB director\nin that region to meet with members of his division. I presume,\nalso, that these fellows are making some plans along that line.\nIncidentally, you might want to fill in Dr. George Steiner who\nhas just been elected to replace Dick Lewis on the NAEB Board.\nNaturally, if it is desired, I can spend some time with each of\nthese division groups on Friday morning.\nSince the Board members from Region VI will want to make some\nsort of presentation to the general NAEB group on Thursday\nevening, I will be happy to sit in on a questionsanswer session\nabout the NAEB reorganization, serve as a panel member, or do\nanything that might be helpful to you. Please be assured that the\nabove is only a suggestion since I know that you and the directors\nhave definite ideas about what you want to do. I would appreciate\nyour letting me know to what extent you desire to have me partici¬\npate.\nSincerely,\nHarold B. Hill\nHEH/mlm\ncc: Keith Engar\nJohn Crabbe\nFrank Norwood\nftftnrtrft Stfti nar"
