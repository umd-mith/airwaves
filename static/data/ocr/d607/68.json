Underwood, Jr.\nNAEB Network Manager\n119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Bob:\nI have just placed the order with the men from Ampex, as follows:\n1000 - #311, 600* #|0.6B $ 680.00\n1500 - #311, 1200* * $1.16 1740.00\n1200 - #611, 1200* <§ $1.36 1632.00\nTotal $4052.00\nHowever, this will be reduced fey a rebate on last year’s order. Since we ordered\nwithin the 12-month period {in excess of 5000 reels), the larger quantity discount\nw© get this year will also apply to the tapes we bought last June. Thus we will\nget a refund on last June’s order, as follows:\n2000 - #611, 1200’\n500 - #311, 1200*\n500 - #311, 600’\nTotal Refund\nPrice paid\n~ns3r\n1.22\n.72\nNew price\n.11.$\"'\n1.16\n.68\nRefund\n1140.00\n30.24\n20.16\n4190.40\nWe will also get a 2$ cash discount; thus the total cost to us breaks down as\nfollows: ^\nCost of current order, as above\nLess refund from previous order\nLess 2$ cash discount\nNet bill\n$4052.00\n190.40\n3861.60\n$3784137\nAnd they will pay the freight, and the tapes should be shipped to 55 Best Armory\nwithin a couple of weeks. McBride, in Chicago, will get their share of the com¬\nmission, as last year.\nThey are going to try to get me better prices on the empty reels than they could\nquote me this morning. There apparently is no quantity discount on reels in orders\nof less than 392 - and all we wanted was a gross, as I understand it. Their prices\non empty reels, with boxes, in orders of less than 392, are: 5n reel - 34#$\n7K reel - 38#. 1 told them we wouldn’t need the boxes (their box price is 10#,"
