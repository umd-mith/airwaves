Thus,\nbias and erase noise are included as well as playback\namplifier noise. All frequencies between 30 and 15,-\n000 cycles are measured.\nThe flutter and wow measurements, include all components between 0\nand 300 cycles/sec. using an RMS meter calibrated to read the peak\nvalue of constant amplitude sinusoidal flutter.\nHalf Track Full Track\n64 min. 32 min.\n2 hrs. 8 min. 64 min.\nInstantaneous (tape accelerates to full speed in less than l/lO second).\nAt 15 in/sec. speed, tape moves less than two inches after pressing “Stop\" button.\nPLAYBACK TIMING\nACCURACY\nREWIND TIME\nCONTROLS\n± 0.2% (± 3.6 seconds in a thirty minute recording).\nApproximately one minute for 2400-foot NARTB reel; 30 seconds for 1200-foot RMA reel.\nTape motion controlled by four pushbuttons; Start, Stop, Fast Forward and Rewind. Tape speed changed by a\nMotor Speed Switch and Equalization Switch. Reel Size Switch provides proper tape tensions for NARTB 10/2\"\nreels or RMA 5\" and 7\" reels.\nOUTPUT\nPLUG-IN HEAD HOUSING\nPOWER REQUIREMENTS\nRACK SPACE\nPlus 4 VU output into 600 ohms, balanced or unbalanced. Will feed a high input impedance amplifier directly with\napproximately one volt.\nPlayback heads are contained in a single plug-in head housing.\nEither half or full-track machines require 2.4 amperes at 117 volts A.C. Machines are available for either 50 or\n60 cycle operation.\nStandard 19 inch wide panel with commercial notching.\nCONSOLE DIMENSIONS\nTape Transport, 75% inches of rack space, weight ... 50 lbs.\nElectronic Assembly, 5/4 inches of rack space, weight 73'/2 lbs.\nPower Panel, 7% inches of rack space, weight . ... 1 lb.\n35\" high x 24'//' wide x 24%\" deep; weight 109 lbs.\nOPTIONS TO SPECIFY WHEN ORDERING\nMOUNTING STYLE\nTRACK WIDTH\nPOWER LINE FREQUENCY\nConsole or rack-mount_\nFull track or half track-\n60 or 50 cycle/sec-\nREMOTE CONTROL UNITS\n(Cat. #5763 and\nCat. #5763-1)\nACCESSORIES\nControls, Start, Stop, Fast Forward, and Rewind from a remote location. Catalog #5763 is mounted in a\nwooden case and is completely wired. Catalog #5763-1 is mounted on a flat plate for flush mounting in studio\nconsoles and is not wired.\nVU METER PANEL\nCat. #4331-1)\nIncludes VU meter, attenuation controls and phone jack. The attenuator and VU meter permit control of output\nlevel (otherwise output of the 352 Reproducer has a fixed setting of 4 VU and must be controlled externally)."
