Cue positions are incorporated on\nturntable mixers. Separate audition and program channels\nare provided for maximum flexibility and the monitoring\namplifier may be switched from the turntable cue position,\nprogram line or audition bus. All inputs are terminated\nwhen the switches are in the off position.\nThe BC-3B is of modular construction with etched wiring\nsub-assemblies. It has self-contained amplifiers and power\nsupply. Three preamplifiers are utilized in the design plus\nmonitoring and booster equipment. Recommended oper¬\nating practice is for the inclusion of separate BA-12A\npreamplifiers mounted in each turntable cabinet. The unit\ncontrol circuits include two 24 volt relays for control room\nand studio speaker and On Air light operation controlled\nby microphone selector and program-audition switches.\nSPECIFICATIONS\nInputs:\n6 Microphones (4 Studio, 1 Control Room\nand 1 Announce Booth).\n2 Turntable Inputs .\n2 Remote Lines .\n1 Network .\n1 Tape .\n1 Auxiliary .\nOutputs:\n1 Program Line . 600 ohms +18 dbm\n2 Monitor Speakers . 16 ohms 3 W each\n1 External Monitor . 600 ohms —8 dbm\n2 Remote Lines Cue. 600 ohms +18 dbm\n1 Turntable Cue .50,000 ohms 1 V rms\nGain:\nMicrophone or Turntable Input to Program Line.108 db\nMicrophone or Turntable Input to Speaker (Audition).125 db\nFrequency Response:\nProgram ±1.5 db.30-15.000 cps\nMonitor ±2.0 db.30-15,000 cps\nHarmonic Distortion:\nProgram 18 dbm Output.1% @ 30 cps; .75% @ 50 cps;\n0.5% @ 100-15,000 cps\nMonitor 6 W Total.1% @ 50 cps; 0.5% @ 100-15,000 cps\nSignal to Noise Ratio:\nProgram Channel, Mixer and Master Gain controls\nset for 68 db Gain.68 db below 18 dbm output\nTube Complement:\n2 6V6-GT, 1 6X4, 2 12AU7, 2 12AX7 1 5R4GY, 7 12AY7, 5-MI-11299\n(selected 12AY7)\nPower Requirements.100-130 volts a-c, single phase, 50/60 cycles\nPower Consumption..155 watts\nDimensions....33' wide, 11 Vi\" high, 21W' deep\nWeight ..........88 lbs.\nFinish....t....,.Two tone umber gray\nPanel.Reverse etched aluminum with dark umber gray\nenamel background\nStock Identification .MI-11641\nAccessories\nTube Kit .Mi-11486\nOn-Air Light Relay.MI-11702-A\nOn-Air Sign .MI-11706-1\nBA-12A Utility Amplifier.MI-11232\n.37.5/150/600 ohms\n.37.5/150/600 ohms\n.600 ohms\n.600 ohms\n.150 ohms\n.150 ohms\nSimplified block diagram of the BC-3B Standard Consolette.\nRADIO CORPORATION\nBroadcast Equipment\nAMERICA\nCamden, N.
