Westbrook\nProgram Director\nHO. S * KPFA\n**.Personally, for the record, and as station manager, I want to say that\nay reaction to the series was very favorable. X felt, first of all, that the\nconception of a series of programs of this nature is an assailant one. What X\nwas able to hear of the programs that we presented left me with an impression that\nthey were very well executed, and they were definitely blessed with a welcome\nvitality.*\nBest wishes,\n/a/ Chuck\nCharles Levy\nStation Manager\naua m.
