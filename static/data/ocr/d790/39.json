I should like to speak about them because some Intelligent\nItalians believe they are directly related to a much broader question?\nis Fascism on the way back in Italy!\nI shall not attempt to answer that broader question. About all\na visiting journalist should do at this point, in ray opinion, is to\nfind out what Italians think about it.\nStudent demonstrations, of course, have long been a standard\nfeature of the European political scene. Some older European hands\nmay not have been as impressed as I was with the manifestations of\nNovember 6 and 7."
