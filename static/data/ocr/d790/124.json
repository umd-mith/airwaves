  "text": "Hovey — 3\nWith und erst at©ment, DOXA concluded j \"In the more educated groups It Is\nnotable that there are more pessimists •’*\nDQXA then moved on to break down the answers to this question according to\nthe political affiliation or sympathy of the Italians polled — and here the re¬\nsults are about what one might expect. You could say that the results are\nroughly in line with official Italian party policy and propaganda.\nThus, among the Communists and their left-wing Socialist allies, 5J. per\ncent of the Italians polled said the action of western scientists in handing\nover atomic secrets to Russia helped the chances for world peace. Only 10 oer\ncent in this group said such action Increased the risk of a new war. Nineteen\nper cent of the Communists and fellow traveling Socialist© said such a oassing\nof secrets by the scientists would have no influence on the question of peace\nor war, and 17 per cent said they did not know.\nMoving gradually from left to right across the political spectrum, DOXA\nfound that Italian boclal Democrats and Republicans felt almost exactly the re¬\nverse of the Communists and left Socialists. In this democratic, ieft-of-center\ngroup, only 17 per cent thought scientists passing atomic secrets to Russia\nwere working for peace, against 52 per cent who thought such actlpn increased\nthe risk of war.\nThe contrast to the Communist viewpoint was even more striking among the\nmembers or supporters of Italy*s biggest party, the Christian Democrats. Only\neight per cent of these believed the turning over of atomic secret© to Russia\nby western scientists helped the cause of world peace. Uixty seven per cent\nsaid this action increased the peril of war.\nAmong Liberals and monarchists, 10 per cent thought such a transfer of\nsecrets a contribution to peace and J1 per cent thought it increased the risk\nof war. And, finally, among the supporters of the neo-fascist Italian Dooial\nMovement, eight per cent thought the handing over of atomic secrets to Russia\nhelped the cause of peace and 65 per cent said it expanded the peril of war —\nfigures comparable to those for the Christian Democrats.\nTo summarize this section of DOXA1® report to the magazine Homo, in the\ncamp of the Communists and their allies the idea that scientists who gave Russia\natomic secret® A&&X contributed to peace carried by a margin of five to one.\nBut in all other Italian parties taken together, the verdict was eight to one\nthat such scientists had increased the danger of another war.\nDOXA also asked Italians this question: \"Taking account of all factors —\nhuman and technical — do you believe that from the military point of view,\nRussia or America is the stronger today?\" In Italy, a country allied with the\nUnited States in the North Atlantic treaty organization, the overall results\nwere these:\nFifteen per cent said they believed Russia was the stronger and 32 per\ncent said they thought the United States was the more powerful as of today.\nBut 30 per cent said they thought the strength of the two powerful nations was\nabout on par, and 22 per cent said they did not know.\nThe political party results were about as they had been on the previous\nquestion: 41 per cent of the Communists and their allies said Russia was\nstronger and only six per cent of this group picked the United States, with 33\nper cent saying they thought the two powers were about equal. But among the\nChristian Democrats, to take one other example, only six per cent said they\nthought Russia was the stronger, m even 50 per cent said the United States\nwas the more powerful and 21 per cent said they believed the two powers were\nabout on par."
