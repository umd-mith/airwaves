And\nI believe these aspects make the thing worth reporting.\nI was having my shoes shined on the sidewalk of the Corao when\nthe first storm broke on Home on the morning of November 6. I call\nit a storm because it sounded exactly like one; a great, gathering\nthunderstorm, hurtling down on you in the teeth of a mighty wind.\nBefore I had time to ask the bootblack what was happening the\nstorm was upon us: a storm of shouting, screaming, sometimes chanting\nstudents — most of them 15 and 16-year olds from the media schools;\nthousands of them, completely Jamming the Carso and the sidewalks,\nparalyzing traffic on one of Home's busiest streets; stopping only\nlong enough to chalk on walla, buildings, buses and streetcars insults\nabout iiarshal Tito and Gen. Sir John Winterton, the British military\ncommander in Trieste; epithets about Anthony Eden and the U. 3. A.;\ndemands for the return to Italy not only of Trieste but of the whole\nDalmatian coast.\nThey would stop and scribble frantically with chalk, and then\nthey would rush on, pell me11 and halter skelter, behind their leaders\nwho added a shrill not® to the great wave of sound by blowing wantx\nconstantly and furiously on police whistles.\nThey threatened to turn over a truck whose driver had edged out\ninto the middle of the Corao, hoping to get across ahead of them. They\nscreamed insults at policemen and bus drivers and pedestrians who got\nin their way. Still they came on — and one wondered how many school\nchildren of that age Home had."
