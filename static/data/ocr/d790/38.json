  "text": "Rovey — 10\nthe entire Trieste Free Territory to Italy* They could have coupled\nthis with the candid admission that it was a longrange goal that could\nnot be realized for the present* And they could have promised in the\nmeantime to continue the process of working more and more Italians\ninto civil administration jobs in one Af as a step toward that long-\nrange goal*\nThese Italians say this kind of declaration might have been\nsufficient to ease the pressure on Pella and, if so, would have left\nhim in a stronger long-run position. But others doubt that Pella could\nhave survived, with nothing more than another pious pledge to show for\nhis efforts on Trieste.\nPella’s position with the country still seems to be very strong*\nBut it is on the floor of the parliament that he will survive or fall.\nAnd it is there where the pressures from the strengthened parties\nof the political Right are building up* It is there where those\npressures could become unbearable for the man from Piedmont in the\ncoming weeks and months unless he can bring in something tangible on\nthe iscue that arouses Italian passions more than any other these days*\nThis is Graham Hovey, signing off another letter from Italy* This\nprogram was recorded in the Rome studios of Radio Italians for the\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters — and this is the\nNAEB Tape Network*"
