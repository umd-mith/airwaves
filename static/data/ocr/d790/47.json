X believe they help\nexplain why the Italian students conducted their demonstrations\nreminiscent of the Fascist era on the 6th and 7th of November. X believe\nthey are worth reporting because of the deep concern they are giving to\nresponsible and Intelligent Italians these days*\nThis is Graham Hovey, signing another ^tter from Italy. This\nprogram was recorded in the Rome studios of Radio Italians for the\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters — and this is the\nMAEB Tape Network."
