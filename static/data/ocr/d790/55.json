They sayf perhaps with some Justification, that\nthey know both better than we do. They say they know communism better\nbecause they have had to live with the threat of it in these postwar\nyear© in which better than one out of every three Italians has voted for\nthe Reds ana their Left Socialist allies. Therefore, they do not\nappreciate advice from us on how to cope with this problem.\nAnd they fear that the United States, in its anxiety over the com¬\nmunist problem, is headed down the road to some kind of totalitarianism,\nwhich they generally call Fascism. They cite what they regard as ultra-\nnationalism, exemplified by the restrictive provisions of the NeCarran\nact; the congressional investigations; the attacks on educators and the\npublic schools. And they say: W© know these things well; they are like\nthe things that came to Italy 30 years ago.\nAnother thing that bothers Italian democrats more than any other\nabout American foreign policy is what they regard as our zeal to rearm\nGermany. The Italian government repeatedly has taken a strong stand for\nthe European Defense Community treaty. That's the treaty that would\nrearm western Germans as part of an integrated supra-national, European\narmy. But Italians know that the pressure for rearming the Germans in\nthe first place came from the United States. And they fear the longrange\neffects of such a pft policy."
