Certainly they have an almost\ninexhaustible supply of qualified people for any number of\ndiscussions. Vote \"yes\".\nHELLO NEIGHBOR: A little bit too amateurish for my blood.\nThe production was spotty in many instances and the girl\nnarrator of this program didn't add much to the whole. Have\nto vote \"no\" on this one.\nTHE LIVELY ARTS : I am strongly tempted by this one but it\nappears disorganized to me. Is there some way the program\nmight be re-evaluated so that we have a good clear intro¬\nduction of topic and speaker. Program has merit potentially\nbut needs polishing before I give it a yes vote. In the\nmeantime, a tentative \"no\"."
