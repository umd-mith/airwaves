The series is being planned and presented by\nDr. Menahem Mansoor, an outstanding Biblical scholar who now occupies the chair of\nHebrew Studies at the University of Wisconsin.\nSince the material used on these programs is timely (new evidence is coming to light\nevery day), we suggest that you schedule this series for broadcast as soon as possible.\nThere is so much new evidence that the original plan for ten programs has been\nexpanded into fifteen programs which are now in production.\nSince the programs are now in production, we do not have definite titles for them.\nHowever, the above should help to explain the general content, and, as far as pro¬\nduction is concerned, we are sure all of you are familiar with the work of WHA on\nthe strength of that station1s past contributions to Network programming.\nWhen definite titles are learned we shall pass them on to you."
