His previous series for the Network ran for over a year, and now we are\npleased to announce a new series of 26 30-minute interviews from Europe.\nThis series is made possible through a grant-in-aid from the Educational Tele¬\nvision and Radio Center to the University of Chicago, where the programs are\nbeing edited. Since this editing is now in progress, we are unable to give\nspecific information concerning the interviewees and the subject of their con¬\nversations with Mr. Mayer. This information will be in our hands early next\nmonth, and we will then rush it to all stations."
