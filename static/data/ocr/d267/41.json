Today s mail contained\nsome 65 tape returns; yesterday’s mail brought us about 200 tapes. To\ndub and mail on schedule (Wednesday) we need about 800 additional tapes.\nThus, you can see why we will not mail tomorrow and why you will not receive\nyour tapes when expected. As a matter of fact, there is considerable doubt\nas to whether we will mail an issue this week. The situation is that bad.\nThis deplorable situation has been going on for several weeks now. We have\nhad to erase over 200 master tapes from our master tape storage; also, we\nhave had to dig into our new tape supply (tapes we use to make masters) in\norder to get out several issues: this we cannot afford to do for any great\nperiod of time.\nWith this background in mind, we now wish to give you your choice: either\nyou begin returning tapes regularly and receiving your tapes on time or you\nmay continue not returning tapes and take your chances on when your programs\nwill arrive, for if we find ourselves without tape from returns we simply\nwill not mail.\nAnd, if a choice must be made over which stations will receive programs from\nthe tapes we have on hand, we will give priority to those stations showing\na plus balance on our tape return ledger. Stations owing tapes will receive\nthem in accord with their respective balances: the fewer tapes a station\nowes, the higher priority it will receive.\nThe choice is yours.\nREU/dfc\n12-3-57"
