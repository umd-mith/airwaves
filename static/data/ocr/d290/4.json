Underwood, Jr., Network Manager\nNAEB Network Program Committee\nNAEB Network School Program Committee\nFROM: Harold E. Hill\nDATE: June 14, 1962\nBelow is an excerpt from a letter just received from John Finster, Program Director,\nWETL, School City of South Bend, Indiana. Frankly, my own opinions on his suggestion\nare somewhat divided - his suggestion makes good sense so far as our school stations\nare concerned, but not only departs from what people normally think of as the \"quarters\nof the year” but also would perhaps present seme billing problems for us. However,\nalways wanting to be pliable enough to consider suggestions, I am passing this on to\nyou with a request that you give the matter some thought and pass your reactions on\nto the chairman of your respective committee, who, I trust, will then pass along to\nme (with a copy to Bob underwood) a concensus committee opinion. After that, considering\nall factors, we will see whether a new quarterly system seems called for.\n”1 submit it would be of considerable value to many stations, especially public school\nsystems, if the 3rd quarter were to begin in September and the 2nd quarter were to end\nin May. Consequently, this schedule would more nearly coincide with the school year.\nThis would dictate the 3**d quarter as September, October, and November, the 1st quarter\nas December, January and February and the 2nd quarter as Mir eh, April and May. In view\nof many school stations completing their schedule In late May and beginning again in\nearly September, one can readily see the number of 2nd quarter programs neat used and\nthe number needed in September if the station does not take the 3rd quarter offering.”\nHEH/mlm\ncc: William Barley\nRichard Hull\nKen Kager\nRaymond Hurlbert\nJohn Finster"
