This would certainly cut\ndown transportation costs#\nX am at a complete loss to estimate the budget needed. This would depend\ncompletely on the number of requests for consulting help and the distance\nfrom the home of each consultant to the location, when travel to the loca¬\ntion is necessary# Do not think that it is always# I think that consultants\nshould be paid a minimum of expenses and $50.00 per day# I guess that I\nwould hit the foundation or government for $100,000 for the first year on\na trial basis and then see how it goes. I could handle some of these con¬\ntacts if you wish, though it might be better if you and 1 did it together,\nHarry.\nI am in favor of the three year rotation basis for committee membership.\nWithout such rotation, we run the risk of growing stale because of the lack\nof fresh ideas being fed into the hopper.\nI do not know whether the above is what you wanted, Harry. Here it is for\nwhatever it may be worth.\nSincerely,\nSamuel L. Becker\nChairman, NAEB\nResearch Committee\nSLB;ks"
