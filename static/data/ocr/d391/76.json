He is now an associate\nprofessor at Pittsburgh* Very good production man and quite in¬\nterested in research. He is not only interested in research but,\nunlike many people in our field who claim an interest, he works\nat it! I do not know how well you know John* I believe that he\nis one of the nicest persons I have ever known. When he was at\nIowa, he was a wonderful person to have in television production\nbecause he got on well with everyone and he knew and was friendly\nwith practically everyone on the campus* This facilitated getting\nthese people on programs* I visited the University of Pittsburgh\nthis spring and found that he was quite highly thought of there*\nHe had a chance to move into administration and turned it down in\norder to continue teaching and doing research. Think that he\nwould be an asset to your staff.\nIf there is other information which I can supply, or any¬\nthing else that 1 can do, please let me know.\nBest,\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film\nS LB: raw"
