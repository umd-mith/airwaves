Merrill\nDirector of Research, WKAR-TV\nMichigan State University\nEast Lansing, Michigan\nDear Irvj\nThey didn't waste much time putting the new members of the HAEB research\ncommittee to work I\nHere is my view of the four research projects submitted:\nKUED, University of Utah: I put this one at the top of my li*t of priorities.\nI'm sorry that more exciting hypotheses ar© not being built into this one*\nit seems to be a rather routine exercise in a way. But I think it's worth\ndoing and the sort of thing NAEB should be encouraging. And I think they\nhave the people to do a job.\nOhio State project in radio history: This would have my top priority if\nthe outcome were anything but a slide lecture. However I think this is\nworth doing in any case. (I'd have suggested a visit to our Mass Communi¬\ncations History Center had Sam not made the point} I think some materials\nhere might be worth poking through.) This one, too, seems to be well staffed.\nIthaca College program evaluation: I do not think this proposal merits sup¬\nport as it stands. The proposal itself is very fuzzy about exactly what\nthey intend to do. The budget seems unrealistic; for example it calls for\nat most 100 hours of interviewing each, in what is \"naturally\" a before-\nafter study with a \"cross-section\" of the population. In short I don't\nthink they know what they're doing.\nGeorge Washington University: I see no merit in this proposal whatever.\nIt doesn't seewi worthy of extended comment.\nIt's a pleasure to be working with you on this; wish all these little duties\nwere as painless as this one.\nYours,\nBruce H. Westley\nAssociate Professor\nbhw/bgs"
