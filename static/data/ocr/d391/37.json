Becker, Chairman\nUABB Research Committee\n106 Morningside Drive\nMew York 27, *Tew York\nDear Sam,\nThe forthcoming book on research methods in speech is being\nedited by Clyde Dow of Michigan State University, I believe. I\nheard about the volume through Milton Dickens of our institution,\nwho has prepared a chapter on experimental method.\nWould it be proper for the Research Committee to send a little\nsummary of some of the recommendations or conclusions of the Ohio\nState Research.Seminar when it distributes the next announcement\nof grants-in-aid? Could the Committee conveniently and properly\noffer its services in commenting upon proposals for funds of The\nNational Defense Education Act that members of UAEB may wish to\nsubmit to the Committee? Would it be possible and proper for the\nCommittee to consider the feasibility of seeking further funds\nand making larger grants? These are some of the questions that\noccur to me as I read your letter of March 22. I am not sure that\nthese are the right kinds of questions to be asking, but I do feel\nfairly sure that they are not wholly simple questions to answer.\nHere’s hoping that your Easter season has been a happy one\nand. that Mew York is treating you well.\nCordially,\nKenneth Harwood, Chairman\nDepartment of Telecommunications\nkh:mk\nair mail"
