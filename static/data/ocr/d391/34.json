Srnythe\nActing Drector\nInstitute of Coiimunications Research\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbans, Illinois\nDear Dallas: ^\nYour recent letter to Irv Merrill makes me realise that\nyou never were officially notified of your appointment to the\nNAEB Research Committee. You were included in the roster of\nthis Committee which I originally sent to Chairman Becker,\nbut somehow in transmitting the information on all the committee\nmembers to headquarters your name was inadvertently omitted.\nAnyway, it’s good to see you're already working as a member\nof the Committee and snaking your usual valuable contributions.\nThis note, then, is just to provide official recognition of a\n'situation in being and extend my personal welcome and appre¬\nciation for your willingness to serve.\nMost cordially yours;\nWilliam G. Earley\nWGH:jc"
