  "text": "Proposed Budget for NAEB International Relations Project\nthe NAEB laas been very active in the field of international exchange\nof broadcasting personnel, information and programs, and it is felt that\nactivity in this area should be increased in view of the growing need for\ninternational understanding*\nThe Association is a member of the European Broadcasting Union,\nInternational University of the Air and Prix Italia. However, it has\nbeen possible to have an NAEB representative attend certain important\ninternational broadcasting meetings only when an NAEB member was already\nin Europe as a Fulbright scholar, or on other business, because the\nAssociation has not been in a position to pay expenses. The result has\noften been representation of a quality which does credit neither to the\nNAEB nor the United States. This has also been true at meetings sponsored\nby UNESCO where the NAEB has been asked to represent the United States.\nFunds for such representation should be obtained.\nShortage of funds has also prevented the development of an effective\nand productive exchange of programs between the NAEB and European countries\nThe Association has provided some programs, nearly always in English\nwhich lessens their exchange value, to other countries and has given many\nof its programs to the Voice of America. Such an exchange would be greatly\nimproved if it were possible to develop programs specifically for export,\nespecially if some of these could be done in the language of the countries\nto which they were to be shipped. Funds should be secured to explore the\ndevelopment of such programs.\nBased on the above needs, it is proposed that an annual budget of\n$5,000 be established to meet the most pressing needs in the international\nfield. Such funds would not necessarily be earmarked for specific purposes\nbut would be available for any necessary expenditures in the area.\nSeptember 23, 1958"
