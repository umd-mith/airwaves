This was in line with wishes expressed by the\nmembers at the 19^3 convention.\nAt New York, too, I told you I would mail a report to all active and asso¬\nciate members.\nThe audit has been completed, and attached hereto is the auditor*s report\non the treasurer and his books, and an adjusted financial report. I say adjusted\nbecause the auditor found he knew more than I. There were no major discrepancies.\nHe found me honest. I trust you think as much of me.\nIf you have any questions, any comments, you know I will be most happy to\nhear from you.\nIncidental to the treasurer*s job, Bob Coleman and I have agreed that it\nwould be easier all-around if I kept the books until December 31. He has already\nmade arrangements for a depository and for bond, both of which have been approved\nby the Board. Meanwhile, all accounts will be brought up to January 1. All bill¬\nings as of January 1 are being prepared here to help Bob get started.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident\nFES:h/p\nEnel.\nCC: H. J. Skornia\nCohn and Marks"
