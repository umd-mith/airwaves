Subject __Norik\ni^EB HEADQUARTERS\nAs long as any conversations between Bovik and labor groups are strictly on an informal\nbasis, preferably at THEIR request, I can see no harm being done.\nWhat I was fearful was this: that we would ballyhoo our position and seek out the labor\nunions. Anything that will strengthen our hands in rendering service is o.k. NASB should\nenter the picture only after every other resource has been exhausted and the institution\nin question feels that NAEB can be of assistance. We would then enter the picture\nat their request*\nAgain, I just didn»t want NAEB to be in the position of \"drumming up business\"* If\nmeeting with JCET, NTRC, NCCET is to be a matter of policy making, canft see why Goggin &\nSchenkkan have to be there* Their ego is too much a® it is* All info on their problems\nknown*\ncc: Harry Skornia"
