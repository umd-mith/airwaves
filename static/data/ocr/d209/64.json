Skornia, Executive Director\nNational Assoc, of Educational Broadcasters\n119 Gregory Hall\nUr b ana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nI have read very carefully the recent letters from you to me\nand from Graydon Ausmns to Miss Howard regarding the assignment of\nMr. Novik as a \"consultant on personnel problems\" or, if you will,\nas \"management consultant\".\nI believe all of us are clear as to the actual duties Mr.\nNovik will perform. Accordingly we would be only too happy to use\nwhatever terminology you consider most appropriate. Miss Howard will\nbe away from the office until the end of this week but I shall review\nthis matter with her as soon as she returns. If any change in the\nwording of the grant letter appears to be called for, we will advise\nyou. However I doubt that will be necessary.\nIn any event since the services Mr. Novik is performing\nare the services the grant was intended to cover, I assume you are\ngoing right ahead with all your plans.\nRECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nAPR 2 9 1954\n1?I?I ?|lplM|12| 1|2|8|4|6|(!\nL\nGHGrEH\nG.
