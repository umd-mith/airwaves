Assn, of Educational Broadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois, 119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Ill#\n}Sy dear Harry:\nI will see you in Columbus. By all means, get word out to the\ndirectors and anyone else you wish about a meeting while I am\nthere. As a matter of fact, I was going to meet? with the five\nfellows whom I have been seeing: Dunn, Senna, Schwarzwalder,\nWoodj| and ^\nI can understand why a lot of the guys would worry — and frankly,\nthey have reason to worry — not because of anything which we do\nbut because they are assuming that you can live in the atomic age\nand deal with the most developed form of communication but be\ncompletely isolated from any outside influence. Between us, the\nreason their worry is exaggerated is (a) the major unions have so\nmany other problems that they are not interested in going after\nthe university educational radio TV station and (b) they are\nlocated in areas off the beaten path.\nRest assured that in all my conversations with top level people\nwe never think in terms of a national contract. As a matter of\nfact, it would louse up everything we are doing because we would\nhave to decide whom to deal with, etc., etc.\nThanks for having my future financial interests in mind. I hope\nNAEB will raise the additional funds but so far as Novik is con¬\ncerned, let*s cross that bridge when we get to it. Everything\nX ha ' “ “ * * L \"\" \"■* nd you\nthou m much\nmore I\nstar\nmar 24 /MVX"
