  "text": "Tuesday\nJanuary 26? 1954\nHarry—\nDick called yesterday in Houston., He had some worry about how to handle the\nIBEW man at his meeting—late yesterday—X think I did give him some help—He will\nwrite me at Cuba—V11 be in Miami Beach, Hotel Monte Carlo-Sendy 31 for 6 days and\nthen home—where I will give you full report.\nDick told me he called Bill in Pittsburgh for ideas—he suggested that Bill was\nmeeting^ with a group of Labor People *\nCalled him this morning—as an old fri^d Pittsburgh was not on list of cities\nfor me to contact0 Glad I did anyhow—he has a meeting set for this PM—with IA and\nAFTRA, Told him how to handle the problem. And lucky for our side I am meeting both\nHeller (AFTRA) and Walsh *74) in Miami.\nIt will feelp to know that Pittsburgh is IA Townjno IBEW in here—-so It will be\neasier . Had a very fin® session with Sener—And Day (SaF) Sener is by far ahead in\nhis contacts—layed out his whole approach when he meets with them week of Feb. 1. He\nhas friendly relations with IA-HABET-IHEW, His problem will be when he has to formalize\nhis procedure—-when he adds staff—and goes on for longer time.\nHe is completely satisfied that my formula,as explained to you, if I get it accepted,\nwill help him Immediately to solve his future needs.\nDay, has a. good relationship with BABET-IBEW—Both want to keep XA—out—(strange\nas that may seem). He agrees to formula—and it would solve his present and future needs*\nI am getting staff breakdown for him.\nHouston was a real treat, inspite of all the vovrys*. X got to watch my step. Texans\nare sensitive etc,,, etc*, and he isn*t one of us etc., etc. That's nonsense—he is—\nalert and willing to take suggestions* And frankly after first half hour fee said, \"He will\nbe asking me for help—-Rather then ?is© versa\".\nHis is not an employment problem. There are no Unions in Town except Musicians—And\nI think I can help. Will talk to Petriilo next week. I urged that he stick closer to\nHAEB. He did attend Oklahoma Meeting. Maybe you saw him in SL Y„ ■ He said he was at\nfinftflgh Conr^tiaa*.\nHe is outspoken in his school. Democratic tendencies and respected by School\nAdministration for it. Between us, I will try to help him with Mayor, Roy Hofheinz, an^\nold FM. Ass. Pres — Hope this will give you some idea of present set up.\nHarry, this in confidence. John Schwarzwalder wants help from Pord-from Centre Set\nUp. He needs some equipment. It*e amazing what he does with his little budget. I only\nsaw it on surface, I confess. He got the green light yesterday for a very good Hegro\nProgram-a tie-up with Kegro University. He says every one is scared about his sponsor*-\nBut that he has not had any suggestion of what to do—or what not to do from that source.\nHe will be keeping in close touch with you*\nAe Ever,\n/a/ Hovik\ncopy made 1/28/54"
