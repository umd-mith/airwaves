Station broadcasting has the\ngreat advantage of reaching more people.\nCOMMENT: The dean of our division is interested chiefly in closed circuit TV.\nCOMMENT: The Eastern oolleges are experimenting, publishing, and spreading\nthe word about closed circuit. All this is stealing publicity from\nbroadoasting.\nCOMMENT: We used closed circuit to pre-test shows. (Mamet)\nCOMMENT: The Texas Dental School has a new building equipped with TV\ncameras in the operating rooms and monitors in the many small\nlaboratory classrooms. A major part of the instruction is by\ntelevision. (Schwarzwalder)\nCOMMENT: Closed circuit does have the advantage of permitting transmission\nof more than one TV course at a time. (Schenkkan)\nCOMMENT: We may operate an inaotive TJHF rig as a kind of closed circuit\nfor campus teaching. Anything normally taught in the classroom\nwould do for broadcast, exoept dental and medical instruction.\n(Sohwarzwalder)\nCOMMENT: Closed circuit can be useful in helping us learn how to do ETV.\n(Larson)\nCOMMENT: It can also help in training the faculty. It’s not a good\nsubstitute for a station beoause it doesn*t meet service obligations.\n(Steetle)\nCOMMENT: There is danger in the arguments that closed circuit (l) uses\nthe best teacher and (2) saves classroom space. The best teacher\nargument worries teaohers. ETV may not save classroom space. (Arms)"
