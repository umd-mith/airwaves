It was my under¬\nstanding that Siegel was to serve as HAEB representative in the project\ndue to his proximity to the Rockefeller Foundation and John Marshall in\nIlev/ York, allowing for his frequent passing of the word to Marshall as\nhe deemed necessary. I believe it was a part of Marshall’s understanding\nwhen the grant was'made that this would be the arrangement, and I do not\nthink that it would be fitting to alter it without cause. However, there\nis no reason for which Skornia should not be kept abreast of the occas¬\nional reports I do make, and I shall see that that is done. I sympath¬\nize with the peculiar situation in which Skornia must find himself vis-\na-vis this maverick undertaking way out west.\nSincerely yours\nLewis Hill\nPresident\nlhjem\nc.c. Mr. Seymour Siegel\nMr. Harry J. Skornia"
