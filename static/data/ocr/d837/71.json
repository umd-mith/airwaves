I»m sending\nyour letter on to them at once to see how they react. If it’s\nO.K. by them we shall go on from there.\nIn any case, however, I expect wo should need a statement guar¬\nanteeing that these tapes would not be used for broadcast rights,\nthat the scripts will not be published, or if the latter occurs\nthat adequate credit be worked out. Do you believe that there\nis any likelihood of eventual publication use of these materials?\nThe above remarks cover the Richard Eberhart recordings as well\nas those of Mr. Stevens.\nSincerely,\nHarry J, Skomia\nExecutive Director\nHJSicp\nCC: Dr. Newburn\nMr. G. H. Griffiths"
