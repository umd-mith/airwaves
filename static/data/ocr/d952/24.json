Their functions and\npolicies differ also from commercial television. With the rapid development and\nutilization of etv and its growing acceptance by the public and educators, the\nservices of a central, national organization has become increasingly important.\nThe NAEB, with more than a quarter of a century of educational broadcast¬\ning experience, provides the organizational structure for satisfying the needs of\nthose working in, for and (or with) etv. (Etv network programs distribtuion is the\nfunction of the Educational Television and Radio Center.)\n(Listed alphabetically by state, station location, call letters and licensee as of April 1959)\nALABAMA\nAndalusia _ WAIQ\nBirminoham - WBIQ\nMunford __    WTIQ\nState of Alabama Etv Commission\noperates an inter-connected network\nCentral California ETV, Inc.\nSan Francisco KQED\nBay Area Educational TV Assoc.\nCOLORADO\nDenver ..
