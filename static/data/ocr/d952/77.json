This\npublic relations advisory committee would be com¬\nprised of top public relations cunsels in the\nUnited States who have an emotional interest in\nthe aims of the lid,3.\nIf you like t is suggestion, two steps can\nbe taken immediately; the members of your public\nrelations (operating; committee can suggest to you\nnames of leading public relations and advertising\nfirms* presidents who might be of the sort neecied\nfor tils volunteer work, ns you approve of e ch\nname, the suggestor of each name would write to\nhis -an and ask him if he would act in a voluntary\ncapacity.\nThus, when you have a drive for money for equip¬\nment, you can call upon the best brains in the public\nrelations and advertising business to help you with\nsuggestions or with actual deeds.\nI co Id give you some names if you w-nt them right\naway.
