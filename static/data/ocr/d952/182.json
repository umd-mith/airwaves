Siegel\nPresident, NAEB\nWNYC, Municipal Broadcasting System\n2500 Municipal Building\nNew York 7, New York\nDear Sy:\nYour carbons arriving today break my back, and my\nheart. I feel for you.\nEnclosed, highly condensed but up-to-date treasurer\nreport. There*s been little doing financially, so there has been\nlittle change reflected in reports. I apologize, sir, for being\nso derelict in my duties. It isn't the little things, it's the\nlittle things added together that get me down.\nIn my absence,mail coming here will be handled. My very\nefficient secretary, Pern Hartz, will handle what needs to be done,\nand will check with Jim on any questionable matters.\nMy summer address, August 7 - September 7, Box 234,\nDeltaville, Virginia. And, I cannot be reached by phone, and\ntelegrams are worse. Sir, I shall not be at Ames.\nFor what my comments are worth, re. Goldschmidt series.\nI still think N0vember release better, but will hold no personal\nbrief if starting date is changed and people advised pronto. Our\nSeptember and October printed programs have gone to press.\nAlso, I have no objections to discs. I have objections\nto failures in making decisions, and forever delaying things. That\nis the only reason I moved for action in meeting at Battle Creek.\nAnd, here months later people are still talking about changing or\ndoing something else. The Board was present and acted. I say\nthis without malice. I say again, personally changes may be made,\nbut if made, we ought to get 'em made and quit making changes."
