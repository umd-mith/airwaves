All but one of\nyour staff may practice perfect public relations — but let that\none staff member get indifferent and the whole battle may be\nlost.\nso, let's get this straight—\nGood station public relations is a full-time job for everybody.\nNow, when some stranger pays your station a visit . . .\nregardless of zvhether or not he sees a good-looking secretary\nfirst\n® Is he greeted cordially by the first staff member contacted?\n• Is he taken to a place where he can be comfortable while\nwaiting? (Or does he have to remain standing?)\n• Is a sincere and obvious effort made to find the desired staff\nmember promptly?\n• Is a substitute person suggested to avoid an unduly long\nwait?\n• Are a few pleasantries exchanged with the waiting visitor?\n• Is he offered a cigarette, a Coke, or some reading material?\n• Or maybe a brief tour of the studios?\n• Or, to summarize, does he go away after his visit with a\ngood taste in his mouth?\nRemember .\nIf you can answer Yes to all of these, your\nstation qualifies for Merit Badge Number 1.\n. every visitor is an important person."
