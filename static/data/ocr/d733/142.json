In light of the various experiments now under way, additional *\nstudy should be made of special frequencies which might be used for extra¬\nterrestrial broadcasting for educational purposes, and possibly for specific\ndata transmission.\n11. Because of the increasing use of television in education, and\nbecause of the many different aspects and problems in the planning, con¬\nstruction, and operation of educational installations, the FCC should\nestablish a department whose responsibilities would be devoted to the\nproblems of educational broadcasting, and point to point transmission for\neducational purposes.\n* Arrangements are currently under discussion for a supplementary report\nto be prepared by MEB on the potentials of satellite communications for\neducation."
