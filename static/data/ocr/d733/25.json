  "text": "education continue to play a highly significant and stabilizing role in\nthe continued development. Most of the educational stations belong to the\nNational Educational Television Network and schedule regular out-of-school\nand adult education programs. Indications are that this service is ap¬\npreciating qualitatively as well as quanitatively.\nEducational television today is vigorous and progressive. It is\nrapidly being integrated into the instructional processes of the total\neducational system. However, many problems, and many inhibitions and\nhandicaps to its full development in helping to meet the needs of educa¬\ntion, remain.\nThe responses received in this survey of the nation's educational\ncommunity may spell out some of the needs and some of the problems, and\npoint with some clarity to future directions of educational television."
