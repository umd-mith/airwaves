This might lead the reader to conclude that\nthe increase in AH listenership was due to a decrease in EM\nlistenership. However, the fact that the number of EM listeners\nremained the same while the total number of listeners increased\nwould suggest that this increase was a functioning of a gain in\nAM listeners. Approximately the same number of homes continued to\nlisten on Eli radio; 9% of the homes reached listened on EM radio\nduring all three surveys.\nC. The 28% of the population on surveys #1 and #2 listened to WOUI an\naverage of hours and Iu2 hours. The 72% on survey #3 listened to\nWOUB an average of 15*6 hours per week. This was a sizable increase.\nIt was first felt that the fact that WOUB had increased its broadcast\nhours would be an influencing factor; however, WOUI had increased\nits broadcast schedule from 10 hours a day to 16 hours per day after\nsurvey #1 and no increase in audience or listening time was\nexperienced on survey #2, It must be reiterated at this time that\nthe novelty of a new local broadcast operation combined with a well\nreceived radio signal, comparatively good programming and locally\nfeatured programming probably acted as a listening stimulant.\nIII. The ownership of EM radios did not vary appreciably from survey to\nsurvey. The figure remained within the 25-28% catagory. 33% of\nthe respondents who owned EM sets listened to WCUI-EM. 80% of the\nnon-TV set owners listened to WOUB for an average of 16.8 hours per\nweek. This is slightly higher than the average of TV set owners.\nkh% of the non-TV set owners listen to the radio between the hours of\n7-K) p.m. This is seven times larger than the general average."
