In almost all cases it is anticipated\nthat educational stations will fall below the commercial stations\nin coverage achieved*\nb. She advantage to the Association and to individual members will be\nin the area of research,, planning, and analysis of operations.\nCo In view of these facts, it would be wise to notify RAEB Headquarters\nin advance of any public statements made involving this data,\n?. Do we need this kind of data? *\na. The Research Committee recommends its purchase,\nb, I do not feel it necessary to point out to a group of station\nmanagers the value of data on station coverage, or to explain\nwhat station coverage data is,\n8, What stations are reported upon?\na® There are 2k> NAHB member stations reportable in WCS #2. See attached\nlist,\nb, A reportable station is on© reported listened to or viewed by at\nleast10$?f all families in an entire county sometime within a month,\n9, Where do we get the money?\na0 This is properly a matter for consideration of the board. The Research\nCommittee feels this data is of value to the entire membership. For\nexample, although WEAR-TV is not \"reportable,” (due to its TB? channel\nin a VBF area) data about our coverage area in NCS #2 would be of great\nhelp in a special survey operation w© contemplate. Because of its\ngeneral value to all members it would be appropriate for the Association\nto purchase the study out of Association funds entirely.\nb. On the other hand, reportable stations can obviously make greater use\nof the data than non-reportable members. It would seem appropriate\nthat these favored stations might contribute toward a single purchase.\nc. By making this package deal the Association gets the data at less than\n25# of the cost to the smallest commercial advertising agency. Stations\nbuying separately would pay $150 each for local (not statewide) coverage\ndata only.\n10, Is this study reliable and valid?\na. Hie survey methods reported used in NCS #2 appear to me equal or\nbetter than any previous nationwide coverage study. Very good reliability.\nb. Certain statistics released to me on this study agree with known data\nobtained from other sources, Ihe data appear valid,\nc. (Incidentally, this is also the only coverage study less than 5 years\nold.)"
