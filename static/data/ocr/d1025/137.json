Earthquakes are vibrations in the earth.\n2. They are caused by sudden movements of the earth1 s crust.\n3. Earthquakes are one kind of mountain-making forces.\nEarthquakes are closely connected with mountain-making forces, and usually\nhappen in regions of unrest in the crust of,the earth. Sudden movements of the\ncrust cause tremors, or vibrations, which can be felt hundreds of miles away and\nsometimes do great damage. The greatest number of earthquakes are caused by\nsudden slipping between two rock surfaces (a fault plane). Other causes of earth¬\nquakes are volcanoes, landslides, and the falling in of cavern roofs. A very\ndisastrous earthquake.happened in San Francisco in 1906.\nThings to Do:\n1. Study the value of earthquakes. In what ways are they harmful? Are they of\nany use?\n2. Locate on maps the earthquake areas of the earth.\n3. How do earthquakes change the earth? How do they make mountains?\nSources:\n1. Fletcher - Earth Science\n2. Mundt - Earth Tremors\n3. Croneis and Krumbein - Down to Earth\n-17-"
