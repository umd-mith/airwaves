These ”extra}! manuals would be handled simply by\nincluding them on our office Materials Available” list and files*\nI was reluctant to commit us to this without thinking it over and talking to\nHarold about it — I think most of you know how carefully we must plan the use of\nour little space — but we are willing to try it if you would like us to* Let\nJohn.
