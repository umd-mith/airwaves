We form different sounds\nby changing the position of the lips, teeth, and tongue, as we do in speaking.\nThings to Do:\n1. Listen to a recording of your ora voice.\n2* Pronounce different syllables, such as AH, AY, AW, OH, and 00. Note changing\nposition of mouth.\n3. See if you can find what the difference is between these pairs of sounds:\nP and B, T and D, S and Z, K and G. Note what you do when you make these sounds.\nSources:\n1.

For sound to have meaning, we must hear it.\n2. We have special organs affected by sound.\n3. Ears are our sound-receivers.\nOne of the most important things about sound is that it does something to\nus so that we hear. The ear is the special organ by which we receive sounds.\nThe outside ear opens into a short tube, which leads to the ear-drum. When sound\nwaves strike the ear-drum, they make it vibrate. This vibration moves a chain\nof three little bones behind the eardrum, and the chain moves some little tubes con¬\ntaining liquid. In the liquid are the ends of nerves leading to the brain. The\nmoving liquid causes impulses to be sent along the nerves to the brain. When they\n'reach the brain, we hear.\nThings to Do:\n1. Find out what hearing tests are and why they are important.\n2. What can be done to help people who are partly or wholly deaf?\n3. Study models or pictures of the ear.\nSources:\n1. Craig - Science for the Elementary School Teacher\n2.
