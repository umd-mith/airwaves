Chemicals are used to change color.\nColor is important to people, because almost everyone is sensitive to the\ncolors around him, and likes a variety of colors.

Dyes are substances used to give objects desired colors which they do\nnot naturally have. An important source of dyes is coal tar, which is made from\nsoft coal. Coal tar can be broken down into different substances, and then\ntreated with chemicals to produce dyes. Dyes of many different colors can be\nmade from coal tar.\nThings to Do:\n1. Use simple tints or dyes to color cloth samples.\n2. Use color-remover of bleach to remove color.\n3. Use litmus paper, acids, and alkalis to show chemical changes of color.\nSources:\n1.
