  "text": "ALPHABET OF SCIENCE\n1953 - 1954\nTo the Teacher;\nAs in the past, Alphabet of Science will utilize the unifying form of an\nalphabetical science notebook, with a key word for every letter of the alphabet.\nThe series as a whole covers a wide range of scientific information, with three\ngeneral topic areas each semester. The first semester covers meteorology,\nastronomy, and chemistry and physics; the second semester includes physiology and\nhealth, geology, and biology. The first program, \"What is Science?\", is designed\nto give a preliminary look into the range of science, its development in history,\nand the work and methods of the scientist.\nThe key figure this year will be \"Mr. X\". He serves as a narrator, talking\ndirectly to the students, and giving background material, explanations, and\nraising the questions to be considered and answered within each program. He is\nnot necessarily a scientist, but rather a friendly, informal personality embody¬\ning the concept of scientific knowledge and investigation. For this reason, he\nhas been given no more specific name than \"Mr. X\" — for he typifies the whole\nrange of science, with its searching, experimenting, and unlimited scope of pos¬\nsibilities. As was done last year, dramatized incidents will be used to give\ngreater color and exactness to the portraying of history, discoveries, inventions,\nand procedures.\nThe manual is designed to include important facts to be gained from each pro¬\ngram, a summary of each topic, suggestions for post-broadcast activities or dis¬\ncussions, and specific source materials for each subject. A complete bibliography\nis also included. It is hoped that these materials will be helpful to both stu¬\ndents and teachers. Any suggestions or criticisms will be greatly appreciated.\nJean Crr\nWriter, Alphabet of Science\n\\\n-2-"
