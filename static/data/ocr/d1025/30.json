  "text": "FROM: NAEB Radio Network School Committee\nTO: Station managers using school program service\nSUBJECT: Manuals for NAEB School Programs\nAll school program offerings include a teacher’s manual or guide sheet with each\nseries. When a sample of a program series in a particular offering is mailed you,\nit will consist of two sample programs on tape and a manual. The manual is im¬\nportant, too. Do this:\n1. SUPPLY TEACHERS WITH MANUALS FOR EACH SERIES.\nThe Radio Network School Committee advises against the\nuse of NAEB school programs without supplying teachers\nwith manuals or handbooks. This has been done and to\nthe detriment of both the station and the teachers.\nConsequently, teachers get the wrong impression and are\ninadequately introduced to the proper use of radio in\nthe classroom. In some cases, as a result, the stations\nare faced with the job of ,,re-selling,, schools and\nteachers on the use of school broadcasts.\n2. KEEP HANDBOOK OR MANUAL SENT YOU WITH SAMPLE.\nAfter you (the station) have received samples of an\nNAEB school program offering (two sample programs on\ntape and a manual for each series) and you have decided\nto take the series, keen the manual or handbook as vour\nmaster from which you duplicate needed copies for your\nuse.\n3/25/55 jy"
