Many scientists have helped in learning how to use electricity.\nElectricity has been known for a long time, but not too well understood\nuntil fairly recently. Electric current will flow through wires in a closed\ncircuit, as in our homes for electric lights. Electricity flowing through a circuit\nhas three traits: There is a force pushing the electricity (measured in volts),\nthere is a certain amount of electricity being pushed through each minute (the\ncurrent, measured in amperes). and the circuit offers a resistance to the flow\nof electricity (measured in ohms). These names are taken from the scientists\nwho helped discover facts about electricity — the Italian Volta, the Frenchman\nAmpere, and the German Ohm.\nThings to Do:\n1. Use a dry cell and a lamp, with a broken circuit, to test materials to see\nif they are conductors.\n2. Make a list of safety rules for working with and using electricity.\n3. Find out the difference between parallel and series circuits. Make models.\nSources:\n1. Parker - \"Electricity”\n2. Carroll - Understanding our World\n3. Carroll - Understanding the Universe\n4. Craig - Science for the Elementary School Teacher\nProgram No. 11\nKEY\nThings to'Remember:\n1. Messages can be sent by electricity.\n2. Samuel Morse invented the telegraph.\n3. The telegraph helped in the development of the United States.\nA common means of communication, the telegraph, depends on electricity and\nelectromagnets. The electric circuit is opened and closed by a key, making the\nclicks which are known as the dots and dashes of the telegraph code, oamuel F.\nB. Morse invented the telegraph, and the code most used in the United States is\ncalled the Morse code. The telegraph helped to make the United States one\n-9-"
