After read¬\ning it we should not lay it aside just\nhandy for occasional reference but rather\nuse it for continued discussion of our\nproblems.\nThe chief controversy highlighted by\nthe book is posed by the phrase, \"the\ncommunity approach.” What of the\ncontention implied, but not explicitly\nstated, that primary groups are good\nbecause they are necessary? It is easy\nto forget that the “we” feeling has, a\ncounterpart in exclusive attitudes to¬\nward \"they.”\nHere are some illustrations of the\nweakness of the local community ap¬\nproach:\nThe growing fear of government les¬\nsens the areas of cooperation for the\nnational community.\nHow about sectarian interests that re¬\nfuse secular cooperation? Some de¬\nnominations prohibit exercise of suf¬\nfrage because the U. S. Constitution\ndoes not recognize Jesus Christ explicitly.\nHow about the “community of schol¬\nars” admirable in many ways but often\n“high brow” in vicious contempt for\nthose who are not intellectual? What\nof the community of scientists who too\noften assume that it excludes the social\nscientists? Or consider the medical\nprofession which in the United States\nofficially repudiates socialized medicine,\ndefined as something abhorrent, when in\nactual fact as well as sociological theory\nmodern health programs inevitably re¬\nquire more varieties of organization to\nextend benefits more widely? And\nconsider the international situation in\nwhich the hysterical fears of East ver¬\nsus West produce a neutralism that in\nits worst features negates freedom to\nlearn and freedom to teach?\nThe book recognizes that there are\nat least two kinds of communities (ac¬\ntually there are many more) but fails to\nstress the fact that the classical formu¬\nlation of primary groups recognizes four\n(the family, tribe, neighborhood, and\nplay groups) which often actually stand\nin the way of the beneficent secondary\ngroups and institutions.\nCitizens too often protest taxation be¬\ncause it lessens private wealth for fam¬\nily and tribe; the neighborhood resists\n*See review on page 3\ncity planning; the state community re¬\nsents federal power; the play groups set\ntheir special hobbies before the general\nwelfare.\nThe point of this editorial is some¬\nwhat vague but does lead to this ques¬\ntion: Can we not realize more fully that\nthere is one institution, the American\nUniversity, that is, or ought to be, least\nsuspect of exclusive and inimical atti¬\ntudes? It is an organization that rec¬\nognizes both the community approach\nand the institutional approach; it is it¬\nself a community of scholars devoted to\none communal purpose, the creation of\nnew knowledge and broader understand.-\ning. It is universal in its scope, not\nsectional. It is relatively objective, not\nbiased or exclusive. It is committed to\nextension of the best ideas for an ever\nwidening human whole.\nW. S.
