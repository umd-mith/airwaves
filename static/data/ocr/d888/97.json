The length of the aerial is, in fact, dependent upon the\nwavelength to which one wishes to tune. The following table shows the\nlength which you should make your dipole aerial in order to obtain the\nbest results on a given waveband. These dimensions must be accurately\nmaintained.\nFrequency band Corresponding Lenght of each half of the dipole\n(Mc/s) waveband (metres) (the dimension shown in figs.\n25\n11\n9 feet\n1 & 2)\n2 inches (or\n2,80 metres)\n21\n13\n10 feet\n11 inches (or\n3,33 metres)\n17\n16\n13 feet\n2 inches (or\n4,00 metres)\n15\n19\n15 feet\n4 inches (or\n4,65 metres)\n11\n25\n19 feet\n11 inches (or\n6,07 metres)\n9\n31\n24 feet\n3 inches (or\n7,40 metres)\n7\n41\n32 feet\n6 inches (or\n9,90 metres)\n6\n49\n38 feet\n9 inches (or\n11,80 metres)\nShould you have any difficulty in tuning your aerial to any particular\nwavelength, write to us and we will advise you further.\nNote: when used for reception of wavebands other than that for which\nit has been constructed, the folded dipole will behave as a normal good\nquality aerial. Experiments may show that, under such circumstances,\nbetter results are obtainable when both lead-in wires are connected to the\naerial input socket of the receiver.\nRECEIVER\nRECEIVER"
