I am of the opinion, however,\nthat we should extend to Harry the courtesy of paying the 1,9%\nof his salary which would go to his retirement* He would be\nexpected then to contribute $% from his $10,000.\nAs you know, we were prepared to pay considerably more\nthan this to get the man we wanted and I feel that we are justi¬\nfied in making this concession to Harry.\nFrank, Burton, and Jim, the other members of the\nExecutive Committee, should have an opportunity to react to this,\nso I am sending them carbons of this letter asking that they\nnotify me immediately if they have any objections to this pro¬\nposal.\n^y kindest regards.\nSincerely yours.\nurayaon iiusmus\n/President\nGAipse\ncci ^Frank Schooley\nBurton Paulu\nJames Miles"
