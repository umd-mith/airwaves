Hurlbert\nAlabama Educational TV Commission\n807 Protective life Building\nBirmingham 3, Alabama\nDear Raymond 5\nHaving trouble getting help on part tin© basis* %w have\nlists about ready* But am now going over all of them to\ndelete those who are already members. These will be sent\nvery soon*\nAttached is mark-up of new flier (blank) we plan to do here.\nI wanted to get this in press right away. It’s the way we\nsee it here. You’ll note that from this we’ve deleted\nstudent classifications, but leave open the possibility of\ndoing something on this later. Lenny Marks thought this\nthe only part which might later give us trouble.\nI’ve been asked by Harley to hold giving it to press till\nI receive copies of suggestions and reactions from Professional\nAdvancement Committee which were mailed to him. These I\nshould have by the time you receive this. I’ll call if there’s\nany change indicated from what we have.\nThe reason i’ll call, and that you should see the attached,\nthough we can print it, is that in the brochure copy, sent for\nPeneguy (to be printed there)i\n1) Reference to Student category must now be deleted and\nfor the other individual categories should be\nto agree with that In the attached (subject to\n2) |\n).\nSo much for that.\nRegarding the Regional Meeting* I’ve talked this over with\nBill. He feels, with me, that we should limit NAsupport to\nthe same amount we gave other Regions, which was #300.00.\nHowever, if this is partly also a membership push as appears,\nan additional 1200.00 (chargeable against membership drive\nappropriation) would be justified."
