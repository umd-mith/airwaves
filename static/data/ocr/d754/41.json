It occurred to me that HEH used to keep a\nfile on regional meetings etc. - and the reports\nfrom same. If he still does, perhaps these should\ngo in there, as perhaps the only existing record\nof what was done at the region II meet last year.\nIf he doesn't, or if you already have a report,\nplease throw away.\nEnjoyed Jim's note. He'll become a railfan yet.\nIf the current weather here continues, next time\nhe can come to the Midwest by ship—right through\nOhio, Indiana, etc. You should've seen Dotty yes¬\nterday morning, poor gal. She took one look at the\nbasement, where there was about 4, 5, or 6 inches\nof water, and she took off shoes and socks and\nwaded in to save the brochures, letterheads, etc.\nWe lost some but not all that much. And we thought\nthis basement was SAFE. It was supposed to be the\nother one that leaked. However, it's understandable\nWhen I drove home yesterday, all the sewers were\nmaking like fountains. One of the main streets\nhere, Neil, is a main U.S. highway, and it was\nclosed yesterday morning...Lake Neil, it was\ncalled. Some guy who runs a boating goods store\non the street was out giving free boat rides etc."
