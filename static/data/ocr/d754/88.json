  "text": "Draft of possible letter to Raymond Hurlbert\nDear Raymond:\nI'm afraid that the NAEB wouldn't be able to underwrite\ntwo or three hundred dollars worth of expenses for you to visit with\nEd Marrow's office in Tokyo. Let me review the history of this situ-\nxmxm±mam at ion as I recall it.\nI believe\nWhen the matter of your visit to Tokyo first came up,/Harry\nSkornia told youy. that perhaps the NAEB could underwite any add it ional\ncosts you might incur as a result of any side trips you might under¬\ntake on behalf of NAEB. He cited as examples a couple of trips that\nBurton Paulu and Marjorie Lundin undertook in Europe. However, the\nonly expenses paid to them were as reimbursement for the actual costs\nthey incurred to go from either London or Stockholm (Burton was in\nLondon anyway, and Marjorie vias in Stockholm) to whatever city jbx a\nmeeting of interest to the NAEB was being held in.\nIn other words, the NAEB did not undertake to pay any of their\nbasic expenses ajS connected with their own primary mission. Applying\nthis to your case, since you are going to be in Tokyo anyway, there\nwould be no way for us to justify paying part of your expenses. If you\nwere to make a side trip to some other nation, specifically at our re¬\nquest, we would then be able to pay the expenses of that side trip.\nHowever, this would not help you any with your basic financial problem\nso far as your trip to Tokyo is concerned, since we could pay only\nthe extra expesnes occasioned by such a side trip.\nI'm sorry that this misunderstanding has not been cleared up\nearlier, but I thought that it had been in earlier correspondence, and\nthat you understood the limitations upon our budget.\nNaturally, if any side trip does come up which we feel would be\nof specific benefit, we might be able to underwittte the costs, but this\nstill would not apply to your basic trip to Tokyo, or any points en route.\nSincerely 9\nv/atj"
