BURROWS, PROGRAM DIRECTOR\nMr, John Holt\nManager Tape Network\nNAEB\nGregory Hall\nUrbana, Ill,\nDear John:\nIn re POETRY AND SONG\nThis program is largely presented in order to\ngive some music selected by Mr, Mitchell and I think is a\nrather trivial program. The only thing I can find in favor\nof it, is that it is a 15 minute program. When Mitchell\nsings he is pretty good. His voice when he makes comments\nis very poor, indeed. I think the program is entertaining\nbut not educational. I think it could be much better done\nand outside of the 15 minute feature it is not up to the\nstandard of NAEB Tape Network. Ifm sorry to say that I\nwould vote in the negative—NO for this program.\nI enclose votes as far as they have been\nreceived on some other programs. They seem to be very\nslow in coming in and very slow in getting to you, but\nwe have such a big backlog of acceptances that I am not\nworried about hurrying in with the reports.\nHave you ever had any reaction on any programs\nfrom Halyard. I don't seem to get any reports from her at\nall.\nCordially yours,\nWaldo Abbot\nDirector of Broadcasting\nI voted in favor of two of the COOPER UNION\nprograms, only. I think that that is enough to put on the\nlist at one time from one source. The HERALD TRIBUNE programs\nin my estimation are too long. You will also note that I\nvoted against the PHILOSOPHY series from COOPER UNION. The\nletter I had from Northrup said he votes YES for the COOPER\nUNION FORUM but he gives NO vote upon the other COOPER UNION\nprograms. I have received no tapes on the LITTLE ORCHESTRA\nSOCIETY or the ORGAN MUSIC of the CENTURY. I still have two\nseries to report upon—THE EVOLUTION OF JAZZ and THE WORLD\nWE WANT which was received yesterday."
