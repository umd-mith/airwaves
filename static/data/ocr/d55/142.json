Network Acceptance\nSubcommittee\nFROM\nSUBJECT: REPORT FROM EUROPE and THE WANDERING BALLAD SINGER\nWell, there’s more agreement on these two submissions\nthan any other pair we’ve had submitted before, I believe.\nREPORT FROM EUROPE gets three ’’yeses.” Slack’s views\nhave been transmitted already. (Thatis, Mix* views have been\nsent already l) Slack says, ’’The idea has real charm and\nshould reach a wide audience. I am ingeneral agreement with\nthe views expressed by these gents. However, I would have\npreferredto audition what I judge to be a more representative\nprogram. (I question that the one on German Commercial Radio\nis very representative.)\nTHE WANDERING BALLAD SINGER gets approval two to one, with\nSlack voting ”no.” Slack says, \"...pace is rahher slow and\ndull.definitely not of network caliber.” Mix* views are\nknown to all. I agree with both in that I think most of us do\nsomething similar and that a purpose would add immeasurably to\nthe program. The rub is that most of us don’t do this sort of\nprogram, and, therefore, since I think the program is at least\nacceptably produced, I feel it should be offered. If something\nbetter comes along, I would recommend holding this program for\na later or weaker offering."
