But awfully\nsolemn about the whole thing.\nThis a mlggw/intelleetual series, and obviously\na \"pros't^ge\" series, judging from the line-up of\npoets recoMSd — Frost, acLeish, etc. Have heard\nFrost speak a number of times, and I know he* a good.\nMacLeish also.\ngone\nunderstand either hi\nfrom his rather /haul\nhe much /^fea % ye the\nundersfbod or no^.\nBut couldn*t we cull some of the more evanescent\npoets? I think there are probably a few (Mr. Stevens\nfor sure) who would do the cause of acceptance of\nmodem poetry more arm than good.\nBert and I vote *YSS\" for Frost and MacLeish, and\nprobably most of the series. But only if we can,\nwithout diplomatic repercussions, eliminate the\nsuper-esoteric representatives."
