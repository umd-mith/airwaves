I have always contended that we should know In the early\npart of the simer what is being offered by the network so that\nwe can do some intelligent planning for Fall Programming. But if\nI am not mistaken this is the first time that programs have been\nsent out before the first of September.\nI believe we are above average in the number of tapes available\nand dubbing facilities. BUT we have dubbed so many programs for\nsummer use *»** both from network and locally that we are going\nto be hard put to find tapes unless we buy a lot of new ones.\nThat is something which we had not anticipated and will be really\nrough on the first quarter*s budget.\nWhat is being done to take care of the school stations that use\nthe network but are off the air for the summer months? This is\nsomething which I can*t understand. The network is assuming that\nm HXOHE dubs which I doubt is the case. We do because network\nofferings have never coincided with our four program periods.\nThis latest arbitrary action of the network makes us seriously\nconsider dropping the network completely. It seems to me that\nthe network should SERVE the membership and not vice versa.\nJWDiln\ncc: Mr* Graydon Ammm\nMr. Frank E* Schooley\nDr. Armand Hunter"
