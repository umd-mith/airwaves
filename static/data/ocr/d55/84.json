  "text": "NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS\n14 Gregory Hall, Urbana, Illinois\nDear Waldo:\nI'm sending copies of this letter to each member\nof the committee and plan to do so with all future\n\"vote\" letters. I think the committee might be a\nlittle more closely knit organization if we get\nsome idea of how others voted on a particular ser¬\nies. We can't get together to discuss these (which\nwould be the ideal way), so the next best thing\nis to exchange votes, and, most important, reasons\nfor said votes. I've had occasion to see a couple\nof the letters that Dawson has sent to Holt with\nvotes and note that he gives no comment on \"yes”\nvotes. I feel that comments are just as import¬\nant here as for \"no\" votes, so I hope he'll add\ncomments. (Bun - please note). Hope other mem¬\nbers of the committee will feel this exchange of\nvotes is a good idea and will send around copies\nof their voting letters. I'll be looking for¬\nward to seeing them.\nAssociate Director"
