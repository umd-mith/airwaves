I'm going to vote ‘'NO11 on this\ntoo* Sorry!\nI'll bring this list of rejections to New York,\ninstead of sending it down to Urbana*..l,ll probably get to see\nyou there sooner* We will get together as soon as I get in, so\nthat you can give me some dope to present in an oral report\non the Acceptance Committee. I donit seem to have much time\nto go over all of the programs that we’ve had this year and decide\nhow many we’ve accepted and how many we’ve rejected.
