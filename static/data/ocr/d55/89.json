I wer H be able to\nvote on all of ’em in this letter, but 1*11 get to ’em as fast as\nI can and will forward my votes to you promptly, though probably\nin small batches.\nTHE WORLD WE WANT - Herald Tribune Forum - (I'm a little confused on\nthis series, because I understand it had already been approved, with¬\nout audition, last Spring, but now, with some tapes available, John\nhas sent them around, and I guess we’re supposed to vote on them\nagain* At least, that seems to be John’s opinion.)\n— NO - I don’t really have anything against this series - that is,\nanything important. It's just that it isn’t especially good and\na similar program cou d be done by most of our larger universities\nby the use of their foreign students. Also, it is too timely, the\nmoderator is not very good, the musical opening on some of the pro¬\ngrams is a little far-fetched, etc. I think we should only approve\nprograms that will really &M something to the program fare of mem¬\nber stations - this doesn't do it in my opinion.\nINTERPRETATION - KPFA\n— No - I think the idea is excellent, but, for my money, it’s\npoorly done# No introduction to attract the listener? too much\nstraight talk at the start? a discussion of all the examples be¬\nfore playing any (it weud be better to have this come between\nmusics1 examp'©s). All in all, I think such a program could be\nwell done and thus be a valuable addition to the network, but not\ndone as this is.\nIN THE BEGINNING - KPFA\n— NO - Here again, this could be good, but the accent, plus the\nmanner of delivery would kill off the audience before they had a\nchance to get interested in what he was trying to say."
