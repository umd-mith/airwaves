Slack, John Regnell\n/\nSUBJECT: Network programs\nChalkdust: Yes.\n2000 AD: Yes.\nHodding Carter Lectures: Yes.\nSan Francisco: No.\nCarnival of Books: Yes.\nKind David: The quality of this recording is one of the best I've\nheard so far as the frequency response of the tape is concerned, the\nlack of flutter, wow, etc. However, the studio quality is not good.\nThe balance between orchestra and vocalists, particularly the soloists,\nis bad. The main value of a recording of this kind can be realized\nonly if stations can keep it in their permanent music library, and this\nrecording isn't good enough for that. Vote no.\n1 9 loo J\nA M\n7l ?l 9,10,11,12,1,2j 3,4,6,^\ni"
