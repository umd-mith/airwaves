Poor production,\n2, Personalities, particularly Gordon*s, leave something\ndesired,\n3. Program sounds scripted,\nij., A good idea which may be a duplicate of Henthoff *s \"Evolution\nin Jazz,\" a fact which, though not necessarily bad, makes the series\nless desirable,\n5. The piano playing is awful,\n6. Too much music appreciation and too little music. Too much\nverbiage. Would make a better half-hour program. While the series\nmay have direction, the two audition programs seem to have little\ninternal direction. They \"jump around.\"\n7. Some pertinent questions: Are Miller and Gordon sufficiently\nqualified for such a series? Ifi this is questionable, are not there\nlegitimate jazz musicians around who might do such a series? (Some\njazz musicians are music tqachers.) Is this a sufficiently signi¬\nficant subject area to warrant making a grant from our limited funds?\n(Personally, I think it probably is, but in such event I should like\nto be assured of an authentic, well-done series.}\nLooking at this list of reactions, I would conclude that I\nwould not be in favor of making a grant for this particular series."
