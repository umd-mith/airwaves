Mix, Member of the Committee\nSUBJECT* Curtain Going Up with Don Buell, Produetion-WKAR, Michigan State\nCollege, East Lansing, Michigan,\nDATE* December 9, 195b\nCurtain Going Up is neither an original type of program, nor is it\noriginally presented. There is every likelihood that every university\nor college owned radio station has a program much like it. The same\nis probably true for many of the municipally owned stations,\nI would like to see a program of this type originated from some place\nthat was prepared to do the Job more along the interview format with\nplay authors, producers and actors as guests. Well known names in this\nfield would provided more of an audience draw than the type of program\nrepresented by Curtain Going Dp.\nHowever, it is unlikely that such a show will be presented in the near\nfuture, and until such is the case, I vote in favor of making the pro¬\ngram, Curtain Going Up, available on the tape network on three counts,\n1. There is a need, as already noted repeatedly in the past by John\nHolt, for shorter programs within the fifteen and thirty minute\ntime segments,\n2* There are probably many small station operations where faculty\nmembers are unable or unwilling to do a program of this type.\n3. Mr. Buell undoubtedly has a style and personality containing high\nlistener interest. His presentation is both entertaining and\ninformative, and he obviously speaks with authority.\ncct\nAbbot, Holt"
