PROGRAM DIRECTOR\nNovember 19, 1954\nMr. John Holt, Manager\nNAEB Tape Network\nGregory Hall\nUrban a, Illinois\nDear John :\nI think that I reported to you previously that I am in\nfavor of acceptance of the series of programs ,fCitizens at\nWork'1 submitted by the Nat ional Municipal League. I think\nit is an excel lent series despite the fact that the programs\nhave local flavor. The problems are universal in every town.\nIt is very well written, interesting, well produced and very\nfine acting. I am in favor of them fairly. As I understand,\nHarold Hill and Bun Dawson have also favored this series with\nthe result that you can go ahead with it.\n”Other Peoples Business” is not quite as good. I don’t\nlike the woman who does the interviewing. I think that in\nthe program I heard there is a reference to a definite hour\nand the timing was not 14:30 or 29:30, still the content was\ninteresting, well done and a little bit different from any¬\nthing I have herd on UN• I’d be inclined to vote in favor\nof this series, also. In this program Hill has voted No and\nDawson has voted Yes. That makes a two to three vote in favor\nof its acceptance, which as I understand it permits you to go\nahead with the announcing that the series will be available.\nI think Frank Schooley is going to do something about the\nNetwork Acceptance Committee. I hope he does it in the near\nfuture. In the meanwhile, we will continue to hold on with\nwhat amounts to a three man committee. Hill, Dawson and myself.\nWith three people I don’t see how you can get a tie vote, which\nis a very good idea.\nCordially yours.\nUXP aJlSo\nWaI do Abbo t\nDirector of Broadcasting\nv/A: dmw"
