My\nradio career, until recently, did not include\neducational radio. For that reason, I am not\nfamiliar with the work required of a member\nof the Acceptance Sub-committee. Perhaps, you\nwould be kind enough to take the time to\nenlighten me. I will be happy to do all I\ncan for NAEB as a member of this committee.\nJS/eg\nSincerelv,\nl —-\n/Jim slack\nManager, KUSD"
