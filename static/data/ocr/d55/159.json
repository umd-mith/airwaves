According to my\nrecords we have approved of 52 submission. I do not guarantee\nthis number to be c omp lete because ^ f-h-e—\noT-ff-fcj there were many tie votes which were referred\nto John Holt for a decision. Out of the 148 submissions one-third\nor 52 talk programs or series came from the University of Chicago,\ntwelve from KPFA, nine from WNYU, thirteen from non active members\nand national organizat ions• Twenty seven member stations submitted\nprograms or series of programs.\nThe present committee 1953-54 voted upon 112 series\ncasting four votes out of a possible five for each series. The\nCommittee has been most efficient and cooperative. Each member\ngave reasons for either his rejection or acceptance of each program.\nThere were no backlogs, all programs being auditioned and reported\nupobj ororrptly. Mr. Holt at Headquarters was excellent in providing\ninformation concerning each series and informing all applicants\nof the Committee’s action.\nThis leaves the desk clean ...every submission to\ndate has been acted upon."
