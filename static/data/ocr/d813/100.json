A\nclearer picture may be obtained by examining the various\ndivisions to be found in the appendix. It would appear\nthat, in some instances, any expansion has to be handled\nfrom the operating budgets, and additional funds had\nnot been received. On the other hand, the State College\nof Washington has $65,000.00 for expansion, and the\nUniversity of Oklahoma spent $800,000.00 recently for\nnew studios and equipment.\nFunds Provided For the Development\nOf Television\nBecause some stations were awaiting for appropriate\nlegislative action, and others were waiting for admin¬\nistrative developments, at the time these budgets were\nfiled, no further information is given other than noted\nin the appendix. For complete figures, it is suggested\nthat the various budget reports prepared by the Joint\nCommittee on Educational Television be studied."
