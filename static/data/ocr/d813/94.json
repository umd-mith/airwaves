In three divisions there was insufficient\ndata to establish a level, or too few producers being\nemployed by these stations. Many institutions also\nused students to fill the position. Certainly, if\neducational broadcasting is to develop, this part of\nits operation needs to be closely studied. The obvious\nquestion is how well can these stations maintain high\nstandards when so few of them have producers?
