It\ntakes time and energy to promote an expanse of activi¬\nties, and anything that may upset existing balances of\nfinance and use of personnel meets \"pillow type\" resis¬\ntance. By this time several departments are involved\nand are active partisans for a more effective plant for\noutlet and development of their interests in radio.\nIt’s the old story of too many places to spend time and\nmoney—and the possibilities in the mass communications\nare an upsetting factor. Some give it the soft pedal\ntreatment.\nConfidential\nUnfortunately, the University administration regards the\nradio station as just another department on the campus,\nand allots money accordingly. The manager is paid $120\nmonthly plus extra money for each course he teaches.\nOnly three student assistantshlps are granted, usually\ntwo clerical, and the other for technical. No funds are\nalloted to pay a program director, sports editor, news\nman, announcers, operators, and writers.\nOur operating budget is divided into several accounts,\nall of them very small for the smount of operation we\ndo (70 hours weekly).\nPast experience has shown, however, that the station can\nbe run on such a small amount bv co-operation with the\nunderpaid, overworked manager.\nOttawa University\nOur operation is one of participation on the part of\nstudents, and the station is staffed by volunteer help\nfor the most part.\nOur figure of $800 includes line charges for remote\nbroadcasts of sports events, leaving about $350 for\nactual station expenses."
