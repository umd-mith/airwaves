Morris\nAssistant to the Director\nEducational Media\nOregon State System of Higher Education\nCorvallis, Oregon\nDear Jimmie:\nThank you for sending me a copy of your letter to John\nWitherspoon relative to the 1964 Region VI meeting.\nI can assure you that, so far as the national office is concerned,\nwe very much want to help plan a successful Region VI meeting\nin connection with the WRTC. Bill Harley and I feel that it\nwould be a good idea to devote a full day to a regional meeting,\nso perhaps, if our Directors in Region VI agree, all day Wednesday,\nFebruary 17, would be a good time, as you suggest*\nAlthough the four HASB Directors in that Region (one from each\nDivision Board) will actually do the planning, the national\noffice was instructed by the Board at its meeting in Columbus\nto assume a more active coordinating role in the various regional\nconferences.\nAt any rate, this is just to let you know that, so far as the\nstaff is concerned, we welcome the opportunity to have a Region\nVI meeting, and would suggest all day Wednesday. I'm sending\ncopies of this letter to the four Directors in Region VI.\nSincerely,\nHarold S. Hill\nHEH/mlm\ncc: John Witherspoon\nJohn Crabbe\nKeith Engar\nDick Lewis"
