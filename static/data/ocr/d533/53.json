It looks as if our brochure will have to be\ndone without a history unless you can find someone to write it\nreal soon.\nYou mentioned that you had some sort of a history prepared\nby Leonard Marks. If you think that would serve the purpose,\nsend It along.\nBurton Paulu sent me an up-to-date membership list. From\nIt, I deduct that we have sixty-two active institutional members\nrepresenting twenty-seven AM stations, forty-five PM stations and\none TV station. In addition, there are forty-one associate Institu¬\ntional memberships for a total of one hundred-and three actives\nand associates* There are still a number of discrepancies, however,\nand I wonder where we can go to get them straightened out. For\ninstance, v/ellace Qarneau at \"estorn Michigan College, is still\nlisted as an associate member and I know that he is operating WMCR\n(PM) which isn’t listed at all. In checking through the Broadcasting\nyearbook, I find a number of stations such as that at Northwestern\nthct are not members. In Wisconsin, we have only two member stations\nand I know there re several in that state, -ho ould know the story\nthere? I’m writing Jim lilies about this but it seems to me that\nwe need to make a cos^lete inventory and start an all-out drive.\nI think I told you 1 sent the list of all new CPs sine© the\nfirst of October to all regional directors. I shall go through\nBroadcasting yearbook listings of all educational stations and\ncheck that list in each region.\nI am eager to know what you thought of the material I sent\nyou for the brochure.\nMy best always.\nSincerely yours.\nGA/ne"
