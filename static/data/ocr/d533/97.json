Siegel\nUNYD, Municipal Broadcasting System\n2500 Municipal Building\nMew York 7, Mew York\nDear Mr. Siegel:\nI have received the announcement of the NAEB Convention to be held\nat Biloxi in November. After looking through the tentative program,\nI find what appears to be a gap in the subject matter to be presented.\nDo you think that it would be advisable to give the local operators\nof commercial television stations a chance to speak to the assembled\neducational broadcasters on the local patterns which have been worked\nout between educational institutions and the commercial operations?\nAnother consideration might be the tactics which commercial and\neducational broadcasters have in common in regard to participation\nin community events. I imagine that many future operators of\neducational stations might benefit a great deal from the techniques\nalready tried in the commercial field, especially those techniques\nwhich weave the station into the fabric of local community life.\nI hope that I will have a chance to see you at the November meeting,\nin the meantime, may I wish you the best of luck in this undertaking.\nDirector of Public Service\nand Publicity\nJCrta\nDuMONT TELEVISION NETWORK\nAMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANY TELEVISION NETWORK"
