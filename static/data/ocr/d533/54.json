I hope to get the\nmaterial on the NAEB membership form back to you before the\nend of the week.\nIt will be swell having you up here in New York during\nthe summer. I will try to cook up something, somehow, to provide\nyou with some sort of part-time job. I have nothing specific in\nmind at the moment, but I am sure something will pop.\nIt is necessary and essential that as much mail as possible\nreach members of the Commission concerning ihe set-aside of frequencie\nfor television. We have never done the information job among our own\ncongressmen and senators which is necessary at the present time. I\nhave reason to believe that a proposed finding will be forthcoming\nfrom the Commission within the next few days. While many of us may\nconsider this to be a great victory, this is merely a proposal and\nis likely to be whittled down unless the pressure is kept up. The\nindustry is working quietly but effectively. In the meantime, the\npermanent Joint Committee will not be formed until March 22. I have\nbeen on the phone several times a day with Washington during the past\ntwo weeks. Whatever letters and telegrams can emanate from you should\nEven if they are reiterations of previous stands, they would be\nextremely helpful.\nInsofar as the printing allocation is concerned, go ahead\nand spend whatever is necessary to turn out a good membership\napplication.\nWith all best wishes, I am\nSNS :as\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational AM and FM radio stations, workshops, and production centers,\nowned and operated by colleges, universities, and public-service agencies."
