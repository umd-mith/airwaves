We should ask the University of Michigan, Iynn Poole and perhaps\nsomeone from Ohio State and Michigan State to be on this section*\nI feel that we should definitely ask the fflJEA officers and program committee to\nset up a session on radio and television and that the time should be divided\nbetween the subject outlined above on TV plus a major section on radio* This\nlatter should call in people who can present dramatically such topics as f,tap$i|g\nthfe total university resources for radio programmingw, ’ cooperation and collabora¬\ntion between the radio instruction divisions and the broadcasting divisions*,\nand \"utilisation of off-campus sources % Consideration might be given also to\nsuch topics as cooperation with coirsnunity, state, and national agencies,\ncoordinating AM, FM, and TV station operations, and a number of others*\nAs to personnel, you know everybody in the broadcasting business as well\nas I do* I would suggest, however, that you make contacts early so the people\nwhom you want can be making plans* In the past, very few radio people have\nattended the OTJ^gggtings* My D©an has never seen fit to take me to one of\nthem because I Mb two out-of-state meetings regularly and he has never felt\nwe co Id afford a third one for me*\nAt the risk of being tiresome, let me repeat that I feel we can make of\nthis a wonderful opportu ity to promote more interest in our educational radio\nand television work, as well as stimulating a number of institutions to go into"
