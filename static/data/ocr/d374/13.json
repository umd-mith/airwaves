The television set itself will soon fit into this\nindividual or small group teaching process since there is under\ndevelopment a tape attachment which will make the standard receiver\nindependent of open or closed circuit telecasts.\n(11) Basic designs for new school construction will have to be\nmodified to facilitate the use of ITV and other new teaching\naids. For example, space will have to be convertible for groups\nof various sizes; means will have to be provided for adapting all\nrooms quickly to ITV, films and individual teaching machines.\nBuilding plans must include provision for adequate power and conduits.\n(12) ITV experiments in Dade County (Florida), Pennsylvania State\nUniversity, and elsewhere indicate that (a) substantial savings may\nbe obtained without impairing quality of instruction and (b) some\nconservation of instructional manpower is achieved.\n(13) ITV can be used effectively for organized teacher training in\ncolleges and universities, as well as for on-the-job instruction."
