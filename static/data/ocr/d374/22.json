RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENT\nThe Governor's Advisory Committee on Educational Television feels that the\npotential for full and unrestricted use of television by all levels of the\nschools in the State of California has great implications in the improvement\nof instruction and in meeting the challenge presented by the rising costs of\neducation during a period of tremendous expansion. Existing legislation does\nnot permit full realization of this potential.\nWith this in mind, the Governor's Advisory Committee on Educational Television\nrecommends that legislation be drafted and introduced in the 1961 session of\nthe Legislature that will accomplish the following:\n1. Education Code Sections 8857 and 23609 presently prohibit school districts,\nthe Department of Education and State Colleges from owning, leasing or\noperating a television broadcast station, therefore;\nIt is recommended that the Education Code be amended to allow those entities\nas named above to become owners and operators of television broadcasting sta¬\ntions subject to the Rules and Regulations of the Federal Communications\nCommission which provide in part that \"non-comrnercial educational broadcast\nstations will be licensed only to non-profit educational organizations upon\na showing that the proposed stations will be used primarily to serve the\neducational needs of the community: for the advancement of educational programs\nand to furnish a non-profit and non-commercial broadcast service.\"1\nFor the purpose of this legislation the reference above to the educational\nneeds of the community shall be interpreted to permit not only instructional\n^Federal Communications Commission, Rules and Regulations, Part 3, 3.621(a)."
