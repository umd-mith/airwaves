At the same time it should be readily admitted\nthat no mechanical device can substitute for the human interaction\nbetween a competent teacher and his students. The real issue there¬\nfore is to find ways of splitting the teaching process into two\nbasic segments which can be supplied by mechanical and electronic\ndevices on the one hand, and by the classroom teacher on the other.\nThis dual approach is not really new because it is in effect em¬\nployed whenever books or any of the other forms of audio-visual\naids are utilized. In fact, this is the obvious way in which\nteachers, by avoiding a great deal of routine, can have the time\nto concentrate on all facets of the learning process.\n(9) It follows from the preceding point that if the teacher is to\ndevote himself more to the individual problems of his students,\nhe will only gain the required time by sharing the purely\ninstructional task with his colleagues on the television screen.\nThis recognition involves a reorientation of the classroom\nteacher's attitudes and procedures, away from the role of a mere\ntransmission belt of information to that of a guide, interpreter,\nand evaluator of student performance.\n(10) In this connection, it should be recognized that the newer\nteaching machines and self-testing devices are not merely\ndesigned for mass instruction. There is a growing trend toward\nindividual instruction and study through such means as language\n•tapes, individual film viewers, and other types of practice"
