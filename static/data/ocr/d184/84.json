  "text": "As has been true in radio, it will be necessary to make feasibility\nstudies' .and surveys in connection with proposed television facilities0 These\nstudies should be made by a team including a competent electronics engineer\nfamiliar with television problems, and a person having managerial and pro¬\ngramming experience in the educational uses of television0 After consultation\nwith USOM personnel and the appropriate host country officials, such a team\nwoiiLd be able to draft a total plan for a television installation and an\norganization designed to achieve maximum use of the facility® ICA should\nindicate a willingness to consider requests for feasibility studies and surveys\nlooking toward the installation of television facilities®\nOf particular interest to ICA should be the development of closed\ncircuit, or low power open circuit, television installations in institutions\nof learning® Such installations are relatively inexpensive and offer the\nmost feasible and practical means available for the multiplication in use\nof available educational resources® Installations of this type have proven\nto be highly successful in the United States, and their number is increasing\nsubstantially each year® It is recommended therefore, that ICA consider the\nestablishment of several pilot television installations in key areas of the\nworld, with the view of improving and expanding the educational program of\nspecific institutions® As these projects develop and mature they can serve\nas illustrative models for other countries within the area® ICA would then\nbe in a position to entertain requests for the development of such facilities\non a wide scale®\nAs regular broadcasting television stations come on the air in\nvarious countries, with or without ICA assistance, opportunity will arise\nfor the development of program agencies capable of using a portion of station\ntime for educational purposes® ICA should give favorable consideration to\nrequests for help in establishing such agencies in all countries where stations\nexist or are about to come into being® Normally, assistance of this type\ncould be expected to take the form of providing a qualified educational\ntelevision advisor who would help the host country organize such an agency\nand provide guidance in its programming efforts®\nA necessary aspect of ICA?s television policy must be the willingness\nto provide training for managerial, programming, and engineering personnel®\nSuch training might include participant training in the United States, and\non-the-job training at the local installation® ICA should favorably consider\nrequests for the training of television personnel®\nThe major technical obstacle in the way of widespread use of television\nin the underdeveloped parts of the world is the availability and distribution\nof receivers® This constitutes a problem that must be attacked with vigor®\nICA should encourage in every way possible the development of inexpensive,\nsimplified television receivers® It is further suggested that through the\nOffice of Industrial Resources, ICA undertake to explore the establishment\nof receiver assembly plants when so requested, and that such plants be imple¬\nmented wherever they are feasible and practical.\n-6-"
