Stone\nKCTS ,TV\nUniversity of Washington\nSeattle 5, Washington\nL^\nDear Loren:\nI have received no invitation from Jack or Jftn to attend the NETRC\naffiliate's meeting in New York, and, although I'm sure this can be\narranged, I feel that I can't take the time to attend in any case.\nI have grudgingly agreed to go the last three days of the Purdue In¬\nternational Seminar. This means that I will not be able to get back\nto Washington until the 19th and I definitely need the Thursday, Fri¬\nday and Saturday before the Board Meeting and the Convention to wind\nup a thousand and one things in preparation for these events. So, much\nas I would like to be there to participate, I believe it a more prudent\ncourse not to try and crowd the Affiliates meeting in on top of every¬\nthing else and 1 will leave the NAEB representation up to you and Hull.\nI know of no particular problems that require a meeting of the TV\nBoard. If the new TV Exchange Committee was ready with a recommen¬\ndation, this might have motivated such a meeting. It will probably\nhave a report and a recommendation ready for the Columbus Board Me¬\neting in May.\nYou'll be pleased to note that we have secured Ken Cox to serve as\nthe FCC expert in the Convention panel dealing with the FCC problems.\nCordially yours,\nWGH/mmm\nWilliam G. Harley"
