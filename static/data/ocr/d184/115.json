Harley\nPresident\nNAEB\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N. W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Bill:\nLast year the NAEB paid my expenses to the meeting of the NAEB Board\nin Columbus. Skornia's attitude at that time was that the association\ncould pay for one Board meeting a year and the individual would have\nto assume the responsibility for the second meeting. My inquiry is to\nknow if this policy still remains and that my expenses to the Columbus\nmeeting would be underwritten by the NAEB. It is necessary that I\nunderstand this arrangement immediately in order to make the proper\narrangements to be away from my work.\nThank you for your attention in this matter.\nSincerely yours.\nRaymond D. Humbert\nDirector, Region II\nRDH/ml"
