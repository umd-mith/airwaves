DAYY\nPUBLIC RELATION'S\nJanuary 3, 1961\nMr. William G. Harley\nPresident, NAEB\n1346 Connecticut Avenue NW\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Bill:\nMay the new year bring you the best of everything both\npersonally and professionally. I hope your holidays were\nhappy - spent in Madison, no doubt.\nBill, I wonder if you would do me a favor? As a result of\nmeeting Bob Schenkkan, Director of Radio and Television,\nUniversity of Texas, at the NAEB Convention here in San\nFrancisco, I am being seriously considered for a job as\nProgram Director for their new station which will go on\nthe air within a year (or possibly by February 1962). He\nappears to be hiring staff now. If you could dredge up\nsome favorable comment (somehow) about me and my professional\ncapacities and pass these on to Bob it might put this over\nthe top - and at long last I would be actively and con¬\nstructively in the field I so much want to enter. It might\nbe well to indicate that you had heard that I had applied\nfor the job - rather than mentioning that I had written\nto you. He has contacted my personal and professional\nreferences already - but there have been budget delays,\nevidently, and I feel this letter would be the right thing\nat the right time.\nI realize you don't know me very well - it was over 12 years\nago. But perhaps I have a nice smile? No? Well, perhaps\nthat it's MEANT to be nicel Anyway - you see what's needed\nhere. My professional accomplishments stand pretty well on\ntheir own - I think he's interested in what I’m like as a\nperson.\nLOS ANGELES • SAN FRANCISCO • NEW YORK • DALLAS • HOUSTON • HONOLULU"
