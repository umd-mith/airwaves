  "text": "The initial cost of' an instructional, television system is substantial0\nHowever, such information ..as is presently available clearly indicates that\nwhen the number of students reached exceeds: approximately 250, the per pupil\ncosts arc less than for traditional instructiono If there is added to the\npicture the value of television in teacher training, and improvement, and the\nprobability of reduced long term goals for the number of teachers and class¬\nrooms, televised education becomes a sound economical investment for the\nnext quarter of a century0\nThus, through educational television wherever it is feasible, a\nmassive educational job can be undertaken at a completely justifiable price0\nIn many situations an equally massive job cannot be undertaken in the near\nfuture through traditional means at any price•\nBecause the educational job to be accomplished in the emerging\ncountries is so vast, the resources with which to attack the job are so meager,\nand the time in which substantial progress must be made is so short, every\nfeasible means for increasing the efficiency of the educational process must\nbe utilizedo Beyond a reasonable doubt, television has the capacity to make\na major contribution in this regard0\nIt is time that ICA assume a posture that will permit the Agency\nto appraise situations realistically and enable it to implement television\nprojects which give promise of significantly augmenting educational programs\nfor both in-school and out-of-school learners•\nPolicy Recommendations\nOne of the vitally important, possibly the most important, aspect\nof television development that should become a concern of ICA is the future\navailability of excellent, substantive program materials and a body of\ntechniques and know-how for producing, adapting, and utilizing these materials»\nWhile extensive programs of research and development aimed at these problems\nwithin the context of United States education are underway, there is no major\nprogram geared to accomplishing the same job on a world wide basiso As tele¬\nvision becomes available on a wider scale, there will be an increasing demand\nfor guidance and assistance in the procurement and preparation of educational\nprogram materials0 If ICA is to have meaningful help to provide, it is not\ntoo soon to attack the complex problems involvede\nICA should undertake an extensive research and development program\nin the communications media field0 Included in such a project would be pro¬\nvision for ■the acquisition ,anc|;; experimental!-production- qf '■ educatprogram\nmaterials for television, the development of methods and techniques of pro¬\nducing such materials and adapting them for use in different cultures,\nexperimentation in the utilization of television materials in differing\nsituations, and the dissemination of information on all of these and related\nproblemso It is not contemplated that ICA would get into the business of\nsupplying programs for regular use0 On the contrary, the materials collected\nwould serve as prototypes to the end that ICA could provide guidance in assisting\nhost countries to acquire or produce their own materials0\n-5-"
