C.\nDear Bill:\nThanks very much for your wonderful help with the NDEA group during\nour recent Washington visit. I am certain your presence was felt\nand that you made a very real contribution.\nFormal congratulations on the excellent way the office appears to\nbe organized and functioning. This certainly is a far cry from the\nold NAEB but it is much closer to what we have always wanted and\nI am sure more than most of us have dared hope for. Keep up the\ngood work!"
