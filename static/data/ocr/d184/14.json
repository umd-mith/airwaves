Second, I want\nto mix in that discussion men from liberal adult education\nwith men from educational broadcasting, who have faced that\nissue in many forms. You know it well! Third, the question\nis how the general interest gets reflected, encouraged, en-\nligh^tend, in the e ducational effort; and what obstacles we\nface, what pressures we ourselves are subject to.\nThe other radio-TV people I have suggested are Henry\nAlter, Boyer Jarvis, and (as a lay publicist) Willard Kip-\nlinger. Will you come along for the ride (and the lunch)?\nIf you’d like to talk about it, and if I can't get to Wash¬\nington before then, perhaps you'd let me know when you are\nin New York and we could get a spot of time together.\nHjOpejfqlly,\ntr\nJohii Walker Powell\nMr. William Harley\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nDupont Circle Building\nConnecticut Avenue NW\nWashington, D. C."
