Harley\nPresident, NAEB\n1346 Connecticut Ave.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Bill:\nPlease note enclosed photostat of letter from Secretary Ribicoff to\nmembers of the Media Panel (See attached panel membership listing)\nOnly change: Governor Collins, for possible conflict of interest\nreasons, withdrew when he assumed his NAB role. Lei and Hazard may\nrefuse a reappointment on the same basis which caused him to resign\n(as did all the rest) from the previous committee, eg. unless the\nSecretary makes the appointment of members, the committee has no\nprestige. Ribicoff's letter represents a compromise between what\nthe committee or the panel asked and HEW protocal which insists\nthat McMurrin make the appointment.\nNext meeting set for June 9-10 in Washington.\nSi neerely\nRichard B.
