Then\na trip to the Netherlands plus the NAEB National Convention disrupted\nthings and 1 never did get around to responding before I took off rather\nprecipitously for Bogota.\nI want you to know, however, that I am not in the habit of\ntreating my correspondence in quite such cavalier fashion, and I do\nwant to beg your pardon for this inattention.\nI saw Scotty a few weeks ago and he believes the book will be\ntop-notch. I am looking forward to its publication. And next time you\ncome to Washington - please give me a call.\nCordially yours.\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGHjadt"
