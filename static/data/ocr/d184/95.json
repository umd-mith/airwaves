Skornia\nSchool of Journalism and Communications\nUniversity of Illinois\nGregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nI would very much like to have you at our meeting\nMarch 15th in Milwaukee. We are going to take up\nsome rather important matters, and I very much need\nthe benefit of your wide experience with NAEB. I\nappreciate the difficulties of freeing yourself front¬\ning teaching obligations, but if there is any way\nof doing so, I hope it can be managed. Your expenses\nwill be paid by NAEB.\nWe would also very much like to have you at the\nbanquet Tuesday night honoring the officers of the\nFund for Adult Education, who did so much for NAEB\nand the cause of educational broadcasting in general.\nFrankly, Harry, I would feel much more confident\nabout the board setting a wise course with refer¬\nence to a couple of important policy matters if I\nknew that you would be participating in the delib¬\nerations .\nCordially yours.\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH :mem"
