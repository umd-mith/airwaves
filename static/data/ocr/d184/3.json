Edwin Browne\nDirector, KPKU\nEES Building\nUniversity of Kansas\nLawrence, Kansas\nDear Ed:\nI believe the enclosed memo to the Board is self-explanatory. I have\nalso enclosed the original document which is to be signed by you and\nreturned to me for presentation to the bank.\nI have asked the Board to send each of us a copy of the signed resolution.\nSince time is very important (i don't want to be in the position of having\nno bank account upon which checks my be drawn for the Association’s\nGeneral Fund), I would appreciate it if you would execute the statement\nfor the bank as soon as you have a total of nine signed resolutions man\nBoard members - tliat win constitute a majority of the total membership\nof 16 on the Board. I am hopeful that you will be able to return this\nto me by January 8, but that will depend on how prompt all of the Board\nmembers are.\nShanks for your help. 1*11 affix the HAEB seal after you have returned\nthe signed document for the bank.\nRegards,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nHEEiabt"
