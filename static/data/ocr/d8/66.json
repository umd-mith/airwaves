You will see that consustants are expected to\nassemble at their respective tables at 11 o'clock, following the coffee break. As\nnewcomers arrive at the various tables it will be the job of consultants to try to\nanswer their questions and perhaps suggest other people who might be helpful and/\nor special Institute sessions that should be profitable. Many of you are well quali¬\nfied to pnswer questions in all of the categories selected; hence, it is possible that\na newcomer may be referred to you personally, even though his question may not be\nrelated to your table topic - at least he can meet you and make a date for a later\nconference.\nYour Table Assignment: _\nTable No. VI * __\nTopic DEVELOPING AND PROMOTING COMMUNITY PROGRAMS_\nChairman Mr. Frank Schooley_\nWill you please meet me in the ballroom at 9:00 a.m. so that we can get organized a\nbit before guests arrive?
