Title 7\ngrants should also be listdd briefly.\nThe years history of legislative progress, in Washington and also in the\nstate legislatures, would be good too.\nMany of us would appreciate & listing of equipment manufacturers and their\nregional representatives since these people often change yearly. Similarly,\nwith services such as consulting, program production, tape to film transfer,\netc.\nI know 1 am asking for an educational TV factbook and that it may not all be\npossible. Let me suggest, then, that all possible headings be listed, and\nif there is not room for a full list of something, let there at least appear a\nreference — directing the reader to the TV factbook or Educational Teleguide\nor wherever the information is to be found. These references could then be\nupdated and save reproducing a lot of material of value only to a limited number\nof people each year.\nGood luck in getting it all into an issue of the Journal. Perhaps you should\nprint it in microtype and mail a reading glass with each copy.\nCordially,\nRudy Brets, Vice President\nTelevision Systems Planning\nRB:h\n\\ cc: Miss Betty McKensie\n119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois 61803\nMr, Frank Schooley\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois"
