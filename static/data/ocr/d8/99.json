Springfield Ave.\nChampaign, Illinois\nDear Frank*\nA question and a suggestion:\nFirst, is there anything doing as far as the Publications Committee\nof the NAEB is concerned? As a member of that committee, I would be\nmost happy if you could forward anything to do.\nSecond, I was wondering about the feasibility of the NAE3 Publica¬\ntions Committee publishing in book form the NAEB \"\"'act Sheets\" sum¬\nmary or summaries that appear in each issue of the Journal? It\nseems to me there is a use for such a publication, which would in¬\nclude all the summaries published to date. I know tha* it would\ntake time to do a little editing; a few might not be \"un-to-date\"\nany more; and if each summary was to be the same lenght as any\nother, some words of the longer ones might have to be eliminated.\nAnd, it would take a sum of money for the actual publication. But\nin their current loose-leaf form, they do not have the same value\nas they would have if published between covers. Perhaps altogether\nthe objections would outweigh any value obtained, but I think the\nidea might be considered.\nAgain, if anything develops on which I can be Of assistance, please"
