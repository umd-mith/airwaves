I will be only too\nhappy to continue as a member of the Publications Committee under\nthe Chairmanship of Frank Schooley.\nI feel, about the proposal for a rotating editorship, that\ntwo slightly better alternatives might be: (l) continue, as in\nthe past, with a permanent editor and make space for a guest editorial\nwhenever the permanent Editor was able to solicit a satisfactory\neditorial. This guest editorial would be in addition to the regular\neditorial. (2) have a permanent editor as in (l) but invite members\nto submit editorials and, from time to time, use the Editor*8 space\nfor one which was felt to be both timely and of high quality.\nMay I take this, my first opportunity, to congratulate you\nupon your election as the first full-time salaried President of\nNAEBI You truly deserved this honor and I am sure you will fill\nthe post with high distinction.\nWith all good wishes to you and your staff, I am.\nSincerely,\nProfessor and Coordinator\ncc *4’rank Schooley"
