  "text": "NAEB Network\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nNovember 23, 1954\nTO: NAEB Network Stations\nFROM: Network Headquarters\nRE: Network Schedule\nEnclosed are three copies each of two \"Network Release Charts\" which we hope\nwill be of assistance to you in handling NAEB Network recordings. Will you please\npass them on, together with this memo, to your program director or other person\nresponsible for this work.\nNot all of the material scheduled to be distributed during the early months\nof 1955 could be included in a single chart the size of these. Thus, we have had to\ndraw up two different charts covering over-lapping time periods.\nThe chart which is marked \"1955-1 *' shows what series will be distributed in\nIssues #1 through #7. It also shows which of these series will be carried on\nthrough later Issues.\nThe chart which is marked \"1955-2\" shows what series have been offered for,\nand will be distributed in. Issues #8 through #24» This chart does not signify that\nsuch series as Stories n Stuff and The University of Chicago Roundtable will not be\ncarried by the Network beyond Issue #20. It signifies only that they have not as\nyet been officially approved and scheduled beyond that time.\nPlease take a few minutes to study these charts. Each horizontal line\nrepresents a program series. The numbers along the line are the sequential numbers\nof the programs in the series. Each vertical column represents an Issue. You can\nsee, thereby, that Issue #15 will be composed of Stories n Stuff #119, Kidnapped #15,\nThey Showed the Way #8, etc.\nWe hope that these charts will be of help to you in keeping track of NAEB\nprograms and planning your schedules.\nJRH:wc\nenclosures"
