Lister was the first to use antiseptics in surgery.\nAntiseptics of many kinds are in common use today, to fight the tiny plant\nand arriTngii organisms which cause human diseases. For many centuries men did not\nunderstand the nature of disease. Many scientists have helped in the fight for\nbetter health — such man as Leeunhoek, Pasteur, Koch, and Lister. Sir Joseph\nLister was an English surgeon who believed that these tiny organisms which caused\ndisease also caused infections in open wounds and after surgery. He.was the first\nto use antiseptics in surgery. Modern clean hospitals were unknown in Lister's\nday.\nThings to Do:\n1. Use a microscope or pictures to study disease organisms.\n2. Make a list of ways antiseptics are used at home.\n3. Study the lives of Koch, Pasteur, Lister, etc.\nSources;\n1. Craig - Science for the Elementary School Teacher\n2.

But milk may contain disease-producing bacteria.\n3. Pasteurization makes milk safe to use.\nMilk is one of our most important foods, but contaminated milk is a cause of\nhuman disease. Certain kinds of tuberculosis in people are caused by milk from\ncows which have had tuberculosis. Most of the milk sold today is pasteurized,\nfor pasteurization kills most of the disease-producing bacteria which may be in the\nmilk, and makes it safe to use. The milk is exposed to a high temperature,\nusually about 140 degrees F., which destroys the organisms and prevents or slows\ndown fermentation. The process is named after the great French chemist, Louis\nPasteur.\n-11-"
