Sunspots are storms, or disturbances on the surface of the sun.\nThe sun is a star, and stars are suns. The sun is very hot, but it is not\nburning. The surface of the sun is constantly stirred up, as if by huge hurricanes,\nGreat streamers of gases, called prominences, are shot out from the sun tens of\nthousands of miles. Observation through a telescope also shows dark spots, called\nsunspots. Some of these disturbances on the sun are many times larger than the\nearth. The exact cause of sunspots is unknown. However, there is some relation¬\nship between sunspots and magnetic conditions and also the aurora on the earth.\nThings....til Do:\n1. Study photographs of the sun, noting solar prominences and sunspots.\n2. If possible, take a trip to an observatory and see sunspots through a tele¬\nscope.\n3. Compare the earth, moon, and sun as members of the solar system.\nSources:\n1. Fletcher - Earth Science\n2. Smith and Jones - En.ioving Modern Science\n3.

Probably the first alloy made was bronze.\n3* New alloys are being made all the time.\nAn alloy is a metal made of two or more metals closely mixed or combined.\nBronze, an alloy of copper and tin, was probably the first alloy madej it was\nknown in prehistoric times. The most important alloys today are those in which\nlarge amounts of steel are combined with smaller amounts of different other\nmetals. For instance, chromium added to steel makes the stainless steel used for\ntableware and kitchen utensils. Scientists are making new alloys all the time,\nand it may someday be possible to make alloys with almost any characteristics we\nwant a metal to have.\n-7-"
