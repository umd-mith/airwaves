Higgy, Director\nNovember 19, 1954\nMr. Frank E. Schooley,\nDirector,\nOffice of University Broadcasting,\nUniversity of Illinois,\nUrbana, Illinois.\nDear Frank;\nI have your two letters re the Engineering\nCommittee and subscription television. I will be happy\nto serve on the Engineering Committee again and do what\nI can for NAEB.\nI do not feel at this time that the subscription\ntelevision matter is clear enough to warrant any definite\nstand by NAEB. It may have very important implications\nfor educational television but at the moment I certainly\nwould not know what kind of a stand to take. I would most\ncertainly not want to oppose it at this stage nor make\nany strong plea for it. I think we will do well to\nsit by for awhile yet.\nWith kindest regards.\nDirector\nRCH/mg\nCopy to Mr. Carl Menzer,\nWSUI,\nUniversity of Iowa,\nIowa City, Iowa."
