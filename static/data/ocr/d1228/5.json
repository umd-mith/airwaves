We do\npublic relations work, and, with some 250-300 high school students, we produce\nscripts for educational programs. Our work culminates with a day in May, when the\nstudents take over a commercial station and run it for 12 hours. Many of our students\ngo on in the field after high school graduation and at that time may have had up to\nsix years of work at the station. In about a year, we hope to move into TV.\"\nKendall Crane. WDUQ-FM. Pittsburgh. Pa: \"Our station, WDUQ-FM, was set up\nin 1949 and in a year we had about 2300 listeners. We are supported by the Univer¬\nsity and have 40 students working with us - four paid staff members, two engineers\nand myself. Wow we have well over 20,000 listeners. We are on the air 364 days\na year with one day out for the annual picnic, and go from 10:00 A. 11. to 1:45 daily,\ncovering 17 different subjects. Our programs are for in-school listening, and we\nare the official station for parochial schools in Pittsburgh. We make use of as\nmuch NAEB material as we can and cover basketball and high school football games as\nwell as the home games of the University.\"\nRosalind Roulston. United Community Services. Boston: \"My work is with the\nUnited Community Services which some of you know as Community Chest and Red Feather.\nIn Boston, however, we are joined into one group which combines just short of 300\nhealth and social welfare services. In 1952, the organization became interested\nin ETV as a means to extend our services in the area. Last December we expanded\nour TV activities and now go all over the Commonwealth and set up workshops known\nas community technical workshops. By way of personal identification I had the\npleasure of being a student at the first WAEB Production Workshop at Urbana in 1953.\""
