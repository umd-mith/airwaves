Prom time to time the University Press publishes\noriginal music. The University also has its own educa¬\ntional radio station, WUOM. If this bill would prohibit\nan educational institution which has a broadcasting li¬\ncense from publishing music such action would have a ser¬\nious and, X am certain, unintended effect on university\npresses throughout the nation.\nThis letter is not sent you to take a stand on the\nother merits of the pending bill, but to inform you and\nthe Subcommittee of the possible effeot which the pres¬\nent language of the bill would have In hampering the scope\nand activities of the University of Michigan Press. I\nhope the Committee will see fit to amend it in such a way\nas to exclude this possibility.\nThank you for your consideration.\nSincerely,\nLMN/vh\nLyle M. Nelson, Director\nUniversity Relations"
