Dob in:\nWHA, the University or Wisconsin broadcasting station,wishes to go\non record in opposition to the provisions of the ^mtliers Bill which\ncould interfere with the normal operations of this non-profit educational\ninstitution as it taay engage in ; tisic publications or recording activities.\nFor example, Ln connection with the Wisconsin School of the Air we\npublish a song-book covering the ausic sung by children in their class¬\nrooms • A teacher^ piano accaiipaniitent book is also printed and distributed\nunder University auspices* A sa pie song-book is enclosed.\nIn the recording field the University has prepared two or three\ndisks featuring Wisconsin songs and usic. ^hen it is not profitable\nfor a co jaercial producer to engage in ths /manufacture of such records\nthe University agy wish to produce its own — not for profit; but rather to\nassure availability.\nObviously the basic intent of the Shatters ^111 is not to hinder\ned cational activities. To assure that it cannot do so we urge that\nproper amendments be added tc clarify the matter and so avoid unfortunate\nconsequences which night accrue without such precautions being taken.\nVery |l?uly fours,\niarold A. *higel\nAssistant director"
