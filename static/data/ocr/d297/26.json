C,\nDear Marcus:\nWhile I think there is little likelihood\nof the Smathers proposal (S 2834) being adopted, if it\nwere to be approved in its present form, it would cause\ngreat harm to the University of Illinois, as well as to\nmany other educational institutions. As an institution\nof higher education and a land grant University, the\nUniversity of Illinois operates non-commercial, educational\nAM and PM radio stations and a non-commercial, educational\ntelevision station. It also operates a University Press,\nand might from time to time publish musical works. As an\neducational endeavor, the University sells a limited\nnumber of records.\nTherefore, it would be of deep concern to\nthe University of Illinois to see the Smathers bill\nadopted in its present form. In connection with your\nrepresentation of NAEB interests, I would be happy to\nprepare any materials which would aid in securing a\ndesired change in language, and if necessary, I feel sure\na representative of the University could be made available\nto testify.\nSincerely yours.\nPrank E. Schooley\nDirector of Broadcasting\nPESfb"
