General descriptive presentations about radio\nand television which have been used for such a long time\nnow take second place to requests for material which is\noriented toward classroom utilization of school programs.\nRecognition of this need by teacher colleges and\ndepartments of education is most encouraging. It is es¬\npecially unfortunate that so few appropriate presentations\nof this type now exist. If there is a proposal that materials\nof this sort be developed under an NoDoE.A. grant, I most\nheartily support it.\nHr. James A. Fellows, Executive Secretary\nEmpire State FM School of the Air, Television-Radio Center\nSyracuse University, Syracuse, N. Y.\nLetter - June 26, 1961\n* & is\nIt has been reported repeatedly in the literature on\nclassroom uses of TV that the success is due largely to the\nattitudes, skill, techniques and adaptation of the classroom\nteacher. Therefore, in-service training for teachers in the\ntechniques of TV utilization becomes of prime Importance.\nSchool systems, teacher training colleges, workshops and all\nother teacher training agencies will be performing a valuable\nservice by equipping teachers with these skills.\n8n Philadelphia we conducted a series of workshops on\nSaturday mornings in order to present this type of training.\nOur orientation courses for new teachers now include pre¬\nsentations to acquaint them with this new and important\nteaching device.\nSince the use of ETV is increasing throughout the\ncountry, there is an urgent need for teacher training.\nDemonstration materials In this connection would be of\ntremendous value.\nHiss Martha Gable, Director, Radio and Television Education\nPhiladelphia Public Schools, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nLetter - June 20, 1961\nUs 'k is H?"
