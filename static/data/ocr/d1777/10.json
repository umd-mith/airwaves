At\nour station we do not want an organization to get into production.\nCOMMENT: Organizations often want to do programs when there is neither\ncontent nor issue. There must be a reason or a real need for\na broadcast — something that needs to be discussed or said.\nThe station should try to find out if there is a need to be\nserved. Sometimes a reason does exist but it hasn’t been\nidentified. Make sure too that the body of the organization\nis concerned and is behind the idea of a broadcast. A TV\nshow is the beginning of a chain of events, not an end. The\norganization can organize viewing groups and start something.\nSome action should follow the program. (Arms)\nCOMMENT: Organizations often think that simply being on the air is\ngood public relations. Public service is service made public.\nQUESTION: Shouldn’t we go to organizations to offer broadcast assistance\ninstead of waiting for them to come to us?\nANSWER: Many organizations hesitate to request broadoast time beoause\nthey don’t know anything about television needs and procedures.\nCOMMENT: The Petroleum Institute is a member of the Denver Council.\nWe have been observing and trying to learn. (Palmer)\nCOMMENT: The need for geo-physioists, oil experts, and scientists is\nimportant. Petroleum interests are assisting KXJHT in explaining\nthis need. They furnish the content and KUHT supplies production\nservioes. (Schwarzwalder)"
