C. 20036\nFebruary 11, 1964\nDear Colleague:\nThe Research Committee of the National Association of Educa¬\ntional Broadcasters needs your assistance.\nWe want to do two things: (1) build a roster of research work\ners in educational broadcasting and (2) compile a list of\ncompleted studies and current projects.\nThe need is clear. Researchers in educational broadcasting\nhave relatively few ways of communicating with each other.\nMuch of the work that has been done is not circulated through\nthe usual channels of scholarly publication. Many of the\npersons doing the work are not members of N.A.E.B.\nThe Committee wishes to take a more active part in putting\nresearchers with common problems in touch with each other on\na continuing basis and to be a clearing house for those who\nare seeking research results.\nWe would appreciate it very much if you would complete the\nenclosed questionnaire, including the part that asks you to\nhelp us to discover active researchers in our field who are\nnot on our initial list.\nThank you! Please use the enclosed envelope to return your\nquestionnaire to the Washington Office.\nFor the Committee:\nPDH:sc\nEnclosures\nPresley D. Holmes, Jr\nChairman, Research\nCommittee\n(Ohio University,\nAthens, Ohio)"
