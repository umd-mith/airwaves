Hurlbert\nGeneral Manager\nAlabama Educational TV Commission\n2151 Highland Avenue\nBirmingham 5, Alabama\nDear Mr. Hurlbert:\nMr. Hill asked me to answer your letter of May 31. The list of active TV\nmembers in Region II, which was included in your letter, is complete and\naccurate except for one new member who joined us last month. The new\nmember is:\nWHRO-TV, Hampton Roads ETV Association, 735 Pembroke\nAvenue, Norfolk 7, Virginia, Mr. Blair L. Mackenzie,\nGeneral Manager.\nI might also point out, at this time, that WXGA-TV (Kaycross, Georgia) is\nnot an active member of the NAEB.\nThe Florida Educational Television Commission (James Etheridge, Executive\nSecretary) is an affiliate member, not an active member.\nMr. Hill talked with Mr. Hull last week and no date has been set for the\nIERT meeting next spring. The NAEB Board meeting will, of course, be during\nthe IERT meeting. However, we can give you no definite information yet.\nI hope this answers your questions. If I can be of further help, please\nlet me know.\nSincerely,\nAnne B. Taylor\nStaff Associate"
