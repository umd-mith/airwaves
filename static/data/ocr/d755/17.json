The site tentatively suggested\nwas Memphis, but no date was set. (The idea of checking with national head¬\nquarters before setting a date was firmly implanted. ) Later in the meeting,\nLen Press asked for a straw vote indicating reaction to holding each meeting in\nsome very central city, such as Atlanta. This suggestion did not seem to be\nwell taken, and Len said he would \"keep the matter under advisement\". Inciden¬\ntally, Graydon Ausmus had suggested to me that every other annual meeting be\nheld in a centrally located city, which suggestion I passed along to Len Press.\nHugh DeSamper did an excellent job as chairman of the Host Committee,\nincluding Jim Sawyer of William and Mary, Randy Brent of WHRO-TV, and\nBill Spiller of WCVE-TV. I wish you could have been there with us.\nWith best wishes,\nSincerely:\nJohn/p oung\nConference Chairman\nJY/af\ncc: Mr. James Etheridge\nMr. Roy Johnston\nMrs. Marjorie Newman\nMr. James Petersen\nMr. Holt Riddleberger\nMr. William Harley\nMr. Jerry Sandler\nMr. Chalmers Marquis"
