Maybe we should have several Vice\nPresidents whose job would be to serve these groups. It’s certain the President\nor an Executive Director can*t do it all.\nSOMETHING OUGHT TO BE DONE ABOUT ALL OF THESE THINGS. I*m getting tired of every¬\nthing in the association being geared to the $ mark. Our Board meetings are taken\nup with haggling over foundations and money. Vte*re forgetting the very spirit and\nessence of educational broadcasting and the scul^we may win in its name. Important\nchanges are proposed.•..nothing is ever done about. I think it*s time we got the\nlead out of our collective breeches and attack some FUNDAMENTAL problems that will\nget us to wheeling."
