At the\nsame time until it was known which organizations would take part it was\nimpossible to calculate their shares of the costs. Thus an element of\nguesswork had to intervene but, in fact, the total costs of the\nOperations Group expenses and the NHK facilities fee amounts to\n360.535 Swiss Francs and, as will be seen above, the amount pledged"
