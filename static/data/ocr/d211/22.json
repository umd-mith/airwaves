Aubert (SSR)\n(Chairman of Jury of International Beethoven Piano Competition)\nIn view of the success of the Beethoven Piano Competition\nin 1970, it would seem possible to envisage a competition organized\nby the EBU for the 1971/1972 season. This time it could be devoted\nto the violin, its form naturally differing somewhat from that of the\ncompetition devoted to the Beethoven piano sonatas.\nThe basic idea would be to have a competition in two parts :\none concerning modern violin making, that is to say a competitive\ncomparison of violins made by contemporary stringed-instrument makers,\nand the other a competition of violin playing - open only to young\nperformers.\nHere below is a suggestion for the general plan :\n1. Violin making competition\nThis competition might take place in one of the towns which,\nhistorically, have been the cradles of masterpieces in\nviolin making, such as Cremona. Participation in the com¬\npetition would be open - via the respective radio organiza¬\ntions - to all countries interested where violin making is\ntruly a traditional art, such as :\nMirecourt in the Vosges\nMittenwald in Bavaria\nMarkneukirchen in Saxe\nSchonbach in Czechoslovakia.\nThis part of the competition would be concluded by the choice\nof a violin adjudged to be the best by a body of experts.\n2. The second part would take place a few weeks after the first\npart and, for instance, each, of 12 countries might send one\nyoung violinist to participate in the competition. The first\ntest would take an eliminatory form but would even entail\nsome awards. It would be advisable to retain 5 or 6 of the\n12 or 15 candidates (the Beethoven competition in fact\nrevealed the necessity of a semi-final in order to select\ntwo finalists from the twelve candidates)."
