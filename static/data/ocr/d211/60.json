Com.\nIstanbul\nEDUCATIONAL RADIO :\nRELATIONSHIP WITH TELEVISION PROGRAMME COMMITTEE’S WORKING PARTY\nFOR SCHOOL AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMES\nThe result of the Television Programme Committee’s con¬\nsideration of the request put forward to it by the Radio Programme\nCommittee in this respect will be found on page 4 of circular letter\n68.119 of 22 January, which constitutes the working document for\nItem 1 of the present Agenda (Decisions of the Administrative Council).\nIt will be noted that the Television Programme Committee recognized\nthe usefulness of maintaining permanent contact with the Radio Programme\nCommittee in this particular field and that it confirmed its invitation\nto the Radio Programme Committee to send two experts to the meeting\nof the Working Party, with the assurance that they would be able to\ntake the floor whenever they wished.\nWhen the Bureau of the Radio Programme Committee came to\ndiscuss this point it felt that it was not, perhaps, necessary for\ntwo members to represent Radio's interests in the framework of this\nWorking Party and it consequently asked the ORTF to make M. Pierre\nBarbier available for this purpose. It is gratifying to record that\nthe ORTF has willingly agreed to make M. Barbier available for this\npurpose and, in the light of the Television Programme Committee's\ndiscussions on the subject, it may now be assumed that the matter\nhas been satisfactorily resolved."
