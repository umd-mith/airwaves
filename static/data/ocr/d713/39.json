Skornia\nDATE: March 4, I960\nSUBJECT: Committees in the\nBecause the Committees of the NAEB — and other volunteer help — are what\nhave made the association strong and broadly based, I d be grateful il you d\nread and react to this note (I wish I had the faculties to make it a personal\nletter to each of you — please consider it as such)* For it represents our\neffort to plan better committees and better use of the tremendous human re¬\nsources of the NAEB in the years ahead*\nThis year we have made as careful and thorough an effort as possible to begin\nto improve committee structure and definitions*\nOn January 29, I sent the chairmen of all Committees and Members of the Board\na memo which read in part:\nnFor the past several years it has been obvious that, although the very foun¬\ndations of the strengths of the NAEB must of necessity lie in committees —\nas the most practical way of identifying and organising talents, problems and\nsolutions on a national basis, and frequently conducting or supervising neces¬\nsary studies and advising on staff efforts, this potential has never been more\nthan minimally realized,\nnl’m sure that there are scores, if not hundreds, of fine people, who would\nbe glad to help, or who are being used as square pegs in round holes,\nnI feel that committees also should offer individuals the opportunities for\nrealizing their best talents, achieving recognition nationally for both them¬\nselves and the NAEB, and providing a channel for their influence and talents\nto be exerted in a broader arena than would otherwise be available,\n”In the interim since my taking over as President, I have not had the time to\ndo this as adequately as I would like. Even though I have consulted with each\nproposed chairman, with the chairman of the Board, the NAEB staff, and various\nothers on committee appointments, this year's committees, once again, are hav¬\ning to be appointed with less knowledge of available talent than they deserve\nand need. I feel this must not occur again.”"
