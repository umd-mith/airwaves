However, the Japanese\nscholar’s tradition of complete devotion to his studies\ncontinues, and in Japan, notable advances have been made in\nnearly all fields of knowledge. Moreover, improving economic\ncircumstances are making possible steady increases in\nresearch budgets.\nJKEJP^UP AND OUT „\nOur guest today is Louis Segaloff, formerly editor and\npublisher of the weekly Kyushu Herald, A former Mr Force\nofficer, Louis has travelled widely in South East Asia,\nmarried a Japanese, and lived how long in Japan?\nAbout 5 years.....\nThe first time I saw your name in print, Louis, was in con¬\nnection with a striking article entitled* Why I married a\nJapanese. I imagine you’ve had a lot of response to that\narticle.\nFrom all over Japan and Korea.\nAnd before we turn to your current article, I wonder if\nyou would sum up your stand, as it were, on the marriage\nquestion.\nYou present Japan, Louis, in this article as the potential\nand active target for propaganda from both sides: Communist\nand Free World. Ninety million highly literate people\nbombarded with views through newspapers, books, pamphlets,\nposters,.speeches, radio and television.\nYes. The high literacy rate, the highest per capita owner¬\nship of radio sets in Asia, their \"open-ness” to cultural\ninformation make the Japanese an accessible target."
