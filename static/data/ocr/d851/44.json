Is not American action in stationing troops in Japan,\nin other words, dictated solely by considerations of her\nown best interests? This feeling is strengthened by the\nfact that when Japan regained her independence the Occupa¬\ntion forces stayed on in Japan.\nThe feelings of various sections of the country and among\nvarious groups: scholars students and intellectuals are not,\nhowever, sufficiently well-defined to be called \"anti-\nAmericanism\" being confined, rather, to a sense of insecurity\nand helplessness in a.world that contains the atomic and\nhydrogen bombs*\nAnd I think these inarticulate feelings might develop into\na strong anti-Americanism, or more likely, a settled frame\nof mind permitting a confident approach to relations with\nAmerica, The most important problem of the future as far\nas Japanese-American relations are concerned is ho?; these\nfeelings can best be guided into the right channels.\nMany thanks, John Ishimoto for exploring the problem one\nreads and hears a lot about, but rarely gets to pin down.\nAnd I think, frankly, the concern about \"anti-Americanist\nis one of the self-conscious nervous tremors of our time*\nThis is John Lerch in Tokyo bidding you Sayonara until next\nweek at this time.\nTHEME UP_MD_0UT_ _\nTape-recorded each week in Tokyo, REPORT I’M JAPAN is\nwritten and produced by John Lerch.\n( END )\nANNCRx"
