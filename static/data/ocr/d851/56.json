But, now, let me turn the discussion over to\nfcJr. Ohrshi.\nLiter first being used in temples as blinds or curtains\nsince their introduction from China during the regime of\nthe Lshi-kaga Shogunate, the cloth curtain came to replace\nthe straw mats used until then. These mots were placed\nat Japanese shop doors for the purpose of keeping out wind\nand sun...but letting the customer walk in.\nThe NOKEN came, in due time, to be looked on as a shop symbol.\nL kind of trade mark and status of reputation wound up in\none.\nForeover, an interesting custom In own as nore-wake or NOREN\ndividing still prevails in Japan. L shop apprentice, having\nbecome an expert in a certain trade and having served out\nhis contracted term of service is formally authorized to\nbegin business. He may do it with the use of his master’s\nseal, coat-of-arms of noren. This, by the way, is a special\nand great honor, accorded only the best and most worthy\napprentices.\nWell, the noren has come to stand not only for the shop\nand its wares but also for its credit or good-will. So that\nany prospective buyer or a shop (apart from paying for the\nbuilding, equipment, stock, etc.) is required to pay for\n’’noren” as a form of good-will payment.\nUsed only before ordinary Japanese “sake” or rice-wine shops\nand restaurants there is a type of noren generally known\nas nawa-noren meaning rope curtain. But here is the original\npurposes From the Chinese characters which compose the word,\n“noren” implies “rattan blind,” This was transformed over\nthe years to mean cloth curtains. Of course, these curtains\nor blinds served to keep out rain, wind, and bad weather.\nThey still do today.\n( 3 )"
