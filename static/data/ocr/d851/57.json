My\nthanks to you Mr. Koji Ohashi for telling us about the noren\nwhich is as common as the neon sign before a shop in the\nnew world. (For that matter, don't think there isn't plenty\nof neon tubing in Tokyo.)\npirBITKODUCE-TmE_m]EFLY..J> UP*... .J#)_OUT_\nSpotlight on...the Emperor of JapanJ Hirohito's change in\nstatus with the post-war Japanese constitution is a good\nindication of what's happened to Japan itsolf...with regard\nto the democratic spirit. His subjects now love him instoad\nof holding him in awe. Mr. Lerch gives a profile on the\nEmperor.\nProbably the most extraordinary sight in post-war Japan is\nthe Emperor, for the very reason that he can now be seen.\nUp to a decade ago, the Japanese people bowed low? and averted\ntheir eyes when the\nImperial Presence passed in a car or even on a train. They\nwould not have dared look at the descendant of the world’s\noldest unbroken imperial dynasty—124th descendant of the\nSun Goddess. But, after the war, the people look straight\nat him: and they see an unassuming man with a toothbrush\nmustache, thick glasses, a shy smile, and a hesitant walk.\nAnd now they like him...the rotogravure pages on Sunday often\npicture tho Emperor at home. Much like the English Sunday\nSupplements which dote on royalty. (PAUSE) Well, Hirohito,\nhis Emperess and the crown prince, Akihito...represent or\nsymbolize unity in the Japanese traditional family life.\nOn New Years Day I happened to be one of the many thousand\nwho swarmed the Palace Grounds. An estimated 100,000 Japanese\ncame to pay their respects as citizens and to look directly\nat their emperor. The man who inspires this devotion is\na curious mixture of ancient tradition and modern tastes.\nHirohito wears only Vie stem clothes, prefers European cooking,."
