Many\nthanks for telling us about SOBA Mr. Tokugen Yamamoto.\nJpipMJP FOR SHORT PUNCTUATION.^.OUT. *\nI'd like to stroll with you now down the Ginza, the most\ninteresting part of downtown Tokyo. It is the heart of the\nbusiness section and is affectionately and officially known\nas GINZA.\nThe crowds surging past the department stores, the staccato\npitch of traffic, the pell-mell pace of people running in\nand out of shops, restaurants, bars, and hotels...this is\npart of the Ginza. But, the couples walking slowly in\nthe dusk, the glittering neon signs, the night spots and\nlittle coffee shops...this is part of Ginza, too. Add to\nthis the fortune tellers, the pin ball parlors, auction shops,\ncurio shops and hot spring hotels. For the Ginza is a place\nof many moods and many activities. It is like the Loop in\nChicago, Union Square in San Francisco, and parts of Fifth\nAvenue. Geographically located between the Tsukiji River\nand the Outer Moat, Ginza has an amazingly small static\npopulation of only 7 thousand people. But when morning\nbreaks, hordes of salaried workers, shoppers and sight¬\nseers converge on the area and the Ginza population leaps to\nhalf a million souls. Then, towards the evening, when the\nbrightly-colored neons shout their defiance at the gathering\ndusk, the working crowds depart, leaving Ginza to the\nnocturanal merrymakers. Later they too depart, leaving\nGinza deserted and forlorn with its little handful of\npermanent residents.\nAt this time, Ginza is a vacuum when compared with its\nsurging life of the daylight hours.\n-5-"
