It is a real pleasure to have your cooperation in this\nmatter and we have high hopes for the final products.\nEnclosed or being forwarded to you are:\n1) approximately fifty copies of the abstracting form which\nyou will use;\n2) four sample abstracts which we prepared (and one proposal\n£#409.17 which you can compare with its abstract);\n3) two sets of \"Directions for.Abstracters\" which should\nguide you in the work;\n4) the thirteen or fourteen proposals which you will abstract;\n5) five copies of the contract.\nIf the contract is agreeable to you, please sign each of the\nfive copies and return them to us immediately in the enclosed envelope.\nAfter they are signed here by Dr. Hall, a copy will be returned to you\nfor your file. You will not need to submit a bill to us on completion\nof the work. Instead, we will initiate payment procedures when the\ncompleted abstracts are received and we are told that three to four\nweeks will be required to put the check in your hands.\nGood luck in the work and let us know of any assistance we can\ngive or any detail which we overlooked.\nSincerely yours\nKarren F.
