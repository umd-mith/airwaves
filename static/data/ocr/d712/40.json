  "text": "-2-\nV\nI have already discussed with Committee Chairmen a three-year rotational basis\nfor committee appointments. Because of some reservations, I was not able to\nput this into effect — except spottily — this year. The objective is, of\ncourse, to preserve continuity and yet involve new people each year. It is\nstill under consideration* I'd like your reactions to it.\nWhat I would like to have from every NAEB member. Is:\n— Any general comment you would be good enough to give us on possible new\ncommittees needed, others which might be deleted or combined, or other\nuseful overall suggestions,\n— An indication of the kind of committee or special assignment you feel you\nwould be interested in. (incidentally several people were this year left\noff committees because I hope, during the year, to call upon them for spe¬\ncial projects of one kind or another.)\n— Suggestions of other good people we are not now using who would be willing\nand able to assist in committee work (with an indication of their special\ninterests).\nIt will require constant thought and effort to make next year's committee\nselections even more appropriate than this year's — of which I think we can\nbe generally proud.\nWe are sincere about this. Any of you who know the scores of hours of effort\nand soul-searching that goes into committee appointments, can attest to this.\nBut we all need ideas and suggestions.\nWon't you take the time to give them to us? Thanks very much.\nHJS:jp"
