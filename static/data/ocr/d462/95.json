The idea of the program, is stated at the top of\neach show: \"Black Voices is for Glack people, but anyone can watch, can\nlisten, can think\".\nThere are many other things in the area of television that are now\nin progress, but we have yet to go beyond scratching the surface in terms\nof a simple form of communicating within the Clack Community.\nI would present for discussions that as we deliberate on the for¬\nmation of a National and local 31ack communication system, we consider\nnot only the question of how we can use television and radio, but more\nimportant, how we can protect ourselves against the impact and ramifi¬\ncations of white controlled media.\nTherefore, I recommend the adoption of the following concept, to\nbe achieved through all of our communication efforts,..\n\"The 31ack state of mind, is the begining\nand should be in the final analysis the\ndetermining factor on which our nation¬\nhood will be developed.\"\n•5"
