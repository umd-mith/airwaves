The service clubs,\nnational parks associations, state and local organizations, all\nunderstood we would see the job through because it was in our\nself-interest to do so.\nI believe this approach has very great possibilities —\nnot just for burden-sharing but more positively for effectively\nmobilizing the economic resources required to help solve major\nsocial problems which are too big and costly for any single\ncompany. In some areas we are beginning to apply the industry-wide\napproach to the hiring, specialized education and training of\nunemployables. Similarly, corporations in the construction and\nrelated industries might jointly supply materials for ghetto\nrebuilding projects — or for the new, stepped-up low income housing\nprogram — at much lower margins than would be the case in their\nregular course of business.\nMost of the major trade associations have done this sort\nof resource mobilization job in wartime, and the government\nfacilitated it by permitting the lifting of certain peacetime\nrestrictions. There is every reason why we should do the same\nthing in the comparable kind of national emergency we now face.\nThe resources are available in the private sector to\nmake the critical contribution to solving our urban, civil rights,\nand educational problems. Total business sales last year, for\nexample, were more than $600 billion. Just a few per cent of that,\napplied to the operating costs of those businesses, and added\nin an organized and equitable fashion to our present efforts to\nimprove our social environment, would make a massive difference"
