This we can understand be¬\ncause of the very conscious and sometimes unconscious efforts made by\nall of the news media (and even those who have served our community) to\nemasculate us and perpetuate the oppressive racist system that disfran¬\nchises, colonizes and enslaves us*\nMow that we have begun to move meaningful 1y to the area of com¬\nmunications, I would urge that our objective to corn..tunicate should be\nbased on a high degree of integrity, to make known ,ionest1y and fairly\nand to avoid certain past practices of the communications media. If we\ncan do this, then the projection of our thing and the revolution, would\nbe a very simple task,\n-2-"
