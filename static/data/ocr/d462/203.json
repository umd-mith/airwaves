But let\nme react on paper, then if you want to call we can take it from there.\nThese are only one man's reactions; I hope they are useful.\nFirst of all, the idea. It is a good one.. .if the scripts are well\nwritten and produced. Who is writing? Will the writer be paid? You\ndidn't suggest that he would be when we talked early this week. But a\ngood writer who can research the problem, understand, and tell the story\nin narration and dialogue forms with humor and perception. . .that takes\ntalent that usually doesn't come cheap.\nIs your budget of $2, 000 per show too high? (Unless you include\nthe services of a professional writer.) I appreciate all the values of hiring\nyour acting company from the ghetto... but these are not pro performers;\ndo they deserve pro salaries... at least that's how the foundations will view\nit. You're not even going after local amateurs with some experience. *, If\nI understand the idea, you want to have the people themselves tell it like it\nis, only in role playing form. Great idea if you can bring it off, but still\nthese people are not trained actors; there is little justification for paying\nthem as such.\nOn the presentation itself, I find it rambles. I get lost between what\nmaterials go into the TV production and what materials are reserved for the\ncoffee discussions which follow. Again, the foundation intellect is geared\nfor brief, concise presentations which tell their story simply, clearly. Go\nback to a basic outline and stick to it. Put things in easily identified cat¬\negories; it makes reading a helluva lot more enjoyable."
