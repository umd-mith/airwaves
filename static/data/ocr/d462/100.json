This means staff — particularly some of the\nbright, young tigers who are often bottled up in the more\nrigid line bureaucracies, and the idealistic college graduates\nwho have been passing up business for the Peace Corps and the\nJob Corps.\nAnd it means money. Since the company has a clear\nself-interest in improving its social environment, this activity\nshould be considered just as much a part of the true cost of doing\nbusiness as any other costs — raw material, sales expense, power\nand light. The monies required for improving the social environ¬\nment should be budgeted and managed as any other operating budget.\nThe public business of the corporation is, in fact, a\nline not a staff function — on exactly the same level as manu¬\nfacturing and marketing. This approach completely changes the\nmeaning of corporate execution of its social responsibilities.\nAs a working line department of the company, the public business\ngroup must be equally accountable for its performance and produce\nsatisfactory results.\nNow that we are organized, how do we tackle the job?"
