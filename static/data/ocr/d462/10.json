At home\nthe question whether rely on the ethnic folk healer or call\nVsAedicari\nan M. D. brings back ugly memories of past sSSk treatment. Later\nthe mother tries to buy a present for the injured son, but discovers\nthat with interest charged by ghetto merchants it would cost twice\nas much as normal retail. The boy knows now that the system is\nleaded against him and walks out, leaving family, and hope behind.\nLike all?soaps\"this one might well go on and on.

On\n\"Cancion de la Raza\" these take the form of community service\nannouncements of particular interests to the residents of East\nLos Angeles.\nHowever, these announcements are not enough. People viewing\nthe program need to know that they are not alone in their hardships\nand confusion. They need to know that there are answers to the\nperplexities of urban life. Every Monday night, preceding the\ndaily episode of Cancion, a new program called LINEA AbIiR^TA (OPEN\nLINE) allows a group of \"experts\" from the community to answer\nquestions gathered from viewers during the preceding week. In this\nmanner, KCET hopes to solve problems rather than create more\nrhetoric. The much touted cliche, \"bridges of understanding\" shoi/|d\nrefer to acts not works, if it is to have any valid meaning.\nCONTACT: Ed Moreno, KCET^ e)#$ /"
