The station also works closely with the local anti¬\npoverty council.\n—■ Station KERA-TV, Dallas, Texas, through its station\nmanager, reports that it has no members of minority groups on its\nstaff, but states that\n\"As a result I have undertaken an active campaign to\nrecruit people from these minority groups for training\npositions and positions of responsibility by Channel 13.\nI have spoken to the head of the Urban League and he has\nput me in touch with several people who are now writing\nand determining whether they could come to work for the\nstation.\nI have not yet had the chance to contact Negro colleges\nin the area, though this will be done within the next\ntwo weeks. The school I think we would especially develop\na great working relationship with is Bishop College.\nI’m deeply concerned about our present status and I am\nmaking every effort to improve it.”\n9. The NAEB believes that these indications of non-discrimi-\nnatory operations are heartening, and demonstrate that the future is\nbright for the advancement of minority groups through all employment\nlevels in the educational broadcast field. The NAEB is determined to\nencourage efforts in these areas, to provide greater employment oppor¬\ntunities not only for Negroes but for women and for other disadvantaged\nracial, ethnic and religious groups as well.\n10. The NAEB also actively supports the Commission’s\nexhortation to all broadcasters to heed the call to conscience and to\nuse their best efforts to contribute toward understanding and communi¬\ncation by white and black, to offer opportunities to Negroes and other\nminority groups to participate in programming, and to provide programming\nwhich will serve specific needs of Negro and other minority audiences"
