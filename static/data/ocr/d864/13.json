They dwell singly, as families, on farms or the\nedges of the service towns, interspersed among the self-sufficient and the\nwell-to-do. Conversely, however, the well-off in income are adversely affected\nby the general paucity of services: poor schools deprive their children too,\npoor hospitals and medical services leave them medically poor along with their\npoverty neighbors - excepting as they can fly out to the larger centers.\nThe Rural Manoeuvre\nUrban mentality and presuppositions have stood squarely in the way of our\ndeveloping a strategy appropriate to the countryside. The. ghetto CAP, the\nHeadstart and Upward-Bound, the Neighborhood Youth Corps, all presuppose an\naggregated population with near-by services available. There are few \"multi¬\ncity\" CAPs.\nThe rural countryside requires that we think in terms of economic areas,\nwhich usually means multi-county organization. It requires that we bring both\ncommunicat ions and transportation into the foreground of our strategy. It\ncalls for the gradual education of the country people into acceptance of urban-\ntype standards for their own social functioning, within the context of spatial\nseparateness. It calls for less emphasis on earmarked programs, and more on\ncollaborative planning and action with USDA TAPs, FHA, co-operative programs,\nand outreach; and more closely coordinated efforts with PHS, HUD, EDA, RC & D,\nCEP, CAMPS. . ,\nIn a Montana village of fifty families, there is no doctor, no nurse; the\nnearest hospital is 40 miles away.
