  "text": "Representatives in favor of Jefferson. His presidency (l801 - 1809) was sig¬\nnalized by the repudiation of the Alien and Sedition Acts and the purchase of\nLouisiana, and towards its end was troubled by the infringements of the rights\nof the United States as a neutral nation in a time of general European war.\nJefferson aroused bitter opposition by his commercial policies, notably\nhis Embargo, and he was also bitterly attacked by New Englanders for his lib¬\neral religious views. After his retirement to Monticello, where he remained\nuntil his death (l809 - 1826), some of this hostility continued, but his friend¬\nship with John Adams was happily restored and led to a notable correspondence\nbetween these old patriots. Their death on the same day, the fiftieth anni¬\nversary of the Declaration of Independence, was one of the most dramatic co¬\nincidences in American history.\nJefferson's last years were clouded by financial difficulties, but they\nwere brightened by his success in starting the University of Virginia (char¬\ntered 1819). As the inscription on his tombstone at Monticello shows, he him¬\nself valued his services to the cause of public education next after those to\nthe cause of freedom. He is generally regarded as the most versatile of great\nAmericans and his extraordinarily diverse activities cannot be readily sum¬\nmarized, but he has remained through the years the most conspicuous American\nsymbol of freedom and enlightenment.\n*For text of Alien and Sedition Acts see pages 51 - 53*\n11"
