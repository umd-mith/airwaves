To his interpretation of Jefferson* Mr. Rains is bringing forcefulness leavened\nby humility..,.The Educational Broadcasters have not stinted in other departments\neither. Mladirair Selinsky has provided an eminently helpful score...and Frank Papp*s\ndirection is plain and knowing*\" {Jack Gould* Hew York Times, Sept. 15? 192)\n\"The Jeffersonian Heritage\" is a 13-week half-hour series dealing with the life,\ntimes, principles and philosophy of Thomas ^offorson. However, its purpose is net\nbiographical, but rather to show how Jeffersonian ideals have guided generations of\nAmerican statesment up to the present day.

The meat\nand sincerity in this program, the easy though serious way in which it was presented\nas wall as the sterling quality of the acting performances, type this as a highly\nimportant series. It should be ’must1 listening for adults as well as all schoolrooms.\n\"Program was a combined narration-dramatisa lon format, which had drama, bite,\nand vigor.\" (Variety, Sept. 17, 1952)\n\"The HAEB should be mighty proud of the job producer Frank Papp and his staff\ndid on their 1Herfersonian Heritage3 series. The quality of production and script\nare radio at its almost forgotten best—reminiscent of the glorious days of the\nold Columbia Workshop....\" (Ted Green, Radio Daily, Oct. 21, 1952)"
