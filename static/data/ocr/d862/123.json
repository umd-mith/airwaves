Jefferson's faith still shines like a beacon because it extended also\nto the human and social world, where he believed that eternal truth could also be\ndiscovered by free inquiry. If it be recognized that progress in these spheres\nhas lagged behind that in the physical sphere, it should be asked why this is so.\nQuestions and Topics for Discussion\n1. The inventions of Jefferson which the members of the group may know about.\n2. What enduring interest, if any, is there in his controversy with Buffon?\n3. Why did he make such a point of defending the American Indians?\n4. If Jefferson were to return to earth what, in your opinion, would be the\nchief signs of physical progress - resulting from science - that he would\nnote?\n5. Do you think that the scientific advances would surpass his expectations?\n6. What political and social improvements would he see? What improvements in\nhuman beings?\n7. Would the progress seem to have been greater in science than in other fields?\nIf so, why?\n8. What obstacles, known to you, did the scientific investigator face in\nJefferson's time?\n9. Would you say that there is more, or less, scientific freedom in the United\nStates now than then?\n10. What restrictions, known to you, have the Communists imposed on scientific\ninve stigators ?\n11. What would you expect the effect of this to be on future scientific progress?\nSuggested Reading\nRadioscript in The Jeffersonian Heritage, Ch. VII, pp. 93-99\nSection in the Notes on Virginia in which Jefferson replied to Buffon; Koch &\n29"
