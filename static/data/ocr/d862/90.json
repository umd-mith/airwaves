The important\nthing, he believed, was to see that\nthey got the facts, and that, having\nobtained these facts, they were left\nalone to judge them.\nA new series of historical dramas\nentitled The feffersonian Heritage\nwill begin on Thursday, August 27th\n(8.00-8.30 p.m.) on CBC Trans-\nCanada. The programs have been tape-\nrecorded in the U.S. by the National\nAssociation of Educational Broad¬\ncasters under a Ford Foundation grant.\n(CBC listeners may remember another\nseries, The Ways of Mankind, which\nwas produced for the NAEB by An¬\ndrew Allan of the CBC and relayed\nlater on the Trans- Canada network.)\nA series of historical\nplays prepared in the U.S,\nto explain the Jeffersonian\nheritage — starting this\nweek on Trans-Canada\n-with Claude Rains as Thomas\nJefferson, third president of the United\nStates of America.\nDumas Malone, who is the author\nof several books on Jefferson and\nprofessor of history at Columbia Uni¬\nversity, acted as consultant for the\nJefferson series. In a preface to the\npublished edition of the radio scripts,\nhe wrote: “One man out of the past,\nThomas Jefferson, was seized upon as\nthe best personification and symbol of\ncertain ideas which are characteristic¬\nally American—though most of them\nmay also be regarded as universal—\nand which are still of vital importance\nto our own country and the whole\nfree world in the unending struggle\nagainst totalitarianism ... In seeking\nto make these great ideas live again,\nwe have made use of imaginative\nforms while trying to remain true to\nhistory in spirit.”\nStarred as Thomas Jefferson is the\ndistinguished American actor Claude\nRains, who, says Dumas, “brings to\nthe role not only the dramatic ability\nfor which he is renowned but also a\nrare degree of understanding”.\nThe first of the series’ seven pro¬\ngrams discusses “What the Jeffersonian\nHeritage Means Today”. It deals with\nJefferson’s heart-felt belief in the sanc¬\ntity of the individual and the free¬\ndoms which are rightfully his, and\nthe main dangers that the Jeffersonian\nheritage faces today."
