It calls itself \"the broad middle strand\" of British\nradio.\nThe Light Programme is designed for the man who turns to radio mainly\nfor entertainment, and it is \"home\" for most of the best variety and popu¬\nlar music shows. But it too has news (most of which is exactly equal in\nlistening difficulty to that on the Home Service), some talks (lighter\nthough), and drama (including even a long version of Romeo and Juliet last\nwinter). The staff administering the Light Programme keeps its audience\nhappy, but cleverly slips in a bit of culture—and with excellent audience\nratings too.\nThe Third Programme is clearly for the serious listener. It features\nfull length performances of musical and dramatic masterpieces, very de¬\nmanding talks and lectures, concerts of (mainly) seldom-played music, and\nsome relatively esoteric literary works written especially for broadcast¬\ning. But it is not \"educational\" in the American sense; it offers no\norganized courses, lectures, or other instructional programs.\nAlthough each of the services has its own distinctive character, the\nthree services must be regarded as complimentary rather than competitive.\nBasic planning is coordinated, and an attempt is made to avoid scheduling\nsimilar programs on two networks at the same hours. Furthermore, not only\ndoes each network repeat its own programs (especially is this true of the\nThird), but each also repeats the others1 broadcasts. Thus most of the\nbest variety shows are used by both Home and Light; many talks by Home\nand Third; much serious music by Home and Third; and much drama by Home\n- 16 -"
