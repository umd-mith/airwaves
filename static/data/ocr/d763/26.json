But the BBC is separate and distinct.\nIn this respect it is rather like the American Red Cross. It is definitely\nmore independent of the government than is our TVA. On paper it might\nappear that the BBC is run by the government, but in fact it is not. In\nmy opinion, it may be somewhat subject to government influence; but it is\ncertainly not subject to government control. This whole subject of course\ncould be the subject for an afternoon1s discussion. Let me dismiss the\nmatter now by offering my opinion that the BBC should be considered inde¬\npendent of rather than subservient to the government.\nIt has of course a monopoly on broadcasting in Britain. There are\nmany reasons for its having grown in this way. One is that the country is\ngeographically small, and there is no great need for three or four broad¬\ncasting systems—and probably no support for them either. The basic\nphilosophical justification which has always been advanced in favor of a\nmonopoly, however, is that competition in broadcasting forces standards\ndown, whereas a single unified system can offer a balanced broadcasting\nservice with the ultimate result of elevating public taste. I shall not\nattempt here to judge the merits of this argument. Incidentally the\nprincipal example given by the supporters of monopoly to support their con¬\ntention that program standards suffer in a competitive situation is the\nAmerican systeml\n- Ik -"
