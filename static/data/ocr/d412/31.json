I believe they are\nself-explanatory. I am sure you have given this subject some\nconsideration but if you have not done so X believe it would\nbe worthwhile.\nIn my conversation with Giasheen, I extended no one an\ninvitation to come to our fall meeting but suggested instead,\nthat m were having a fall meeting and it might be possible\nfor a representative of the ARC So discuss our roll in civilian\ndefense with us at that time and that I would contact you in\nregard to the matter if they were interested in doing so.\nPlease take it from here and do what you think best.\nI enjoyed seeing you at llerton House and was parti¬\ncularly glad to have the opportunity of chatting with you at\nsome length. I shall be looking forward to seeing you at\nLexington.\nGlad you sent out the July 28 comniunication* It was very\nwell done.\nVery sincerely yours.\nGraydon Ausmus, Director\nRadio Broadcasting Services\nManager, WUOA(Bf)\nGA/ns\nenc. 2"
