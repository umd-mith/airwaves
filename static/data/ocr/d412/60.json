Thank goodness Leg 4 is the only one\nwhich has been productive of so much change and cross-change\nand what have you.\nThis all comes about because of having too many cooks in the\npie. Everybody, in an effort to be helpful, made various and\nsundry arrangements, but in many instances failed to notify\nall parties concerned.\nGaines apparently has been operating under a letter of\nAugust l&th from Dunn. You have been dperating under our\nmemo of August 23rd.\nI presume, therefore, that the present schedule which is\napparently working out satisfactorily for you and Ausmus\nshould be in effect, i.e., NBC to WLSU to WUOA to WAB3.\nGaines, at WABE, is to forward the tape back to jJrobst\nin Chicago.\nIfll be seeing you at Leatington, I hope, at which time we\ncan commiserate with each other, and use your stack of\ncorrespondence as a shining example (because it is the\nonly one of snafu).\nAs ever,\nSeymour N. Siegel\nDirector\nsns :L\ncc to Alvin Gaines, WABE; GRAYDON AUSMUS, WUOA; George\nProbst, University of Chicago"
