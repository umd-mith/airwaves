Only today have I had a chance to sit down\nto review NAEB matters and try to put affairs in\norder*\nThe first affair, so far as I am concerned, is\nthe News-Letter* You will recall that we requested\nthe chairmen of all sessions to supply me with a\none-page summary of what transpired at their meet¬\nings. I wonder if you could send me by return mail\na summary of your Sunday meeting You wonft have\nto include anything about the report I gave--unless\nyou want to!--put I would like to get a summary\nfrom you for all the rest. This will serve as the\nbasis for a portion of the review of the convention\nwhich I will try to make a feature of the November\nNews-Letter*\nLet me congratulate you again (in writing this\ntime) on your election as vice president. I am sure\nyou will serve us well.\nPUBLICATIONS EDITOR\nBURTON PAULU\nKUOM, University of\nMinnesota\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nDIRECTOR OF STUDIES\nDALLAS W.
