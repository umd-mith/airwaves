C.\nDear Sir:\nI am in receipt of several pieces of correspondence between you and\nNAEB people concerning a possible series on the weather. I discussed\nthis with Dr. Skornia and members of the network sub-committee on program\nplanning on December 3 in Chicago.\nWe have no doubt of the value and general interest of the topic, but\nthe group had some reservations about certain units in the 13 week outline\nyou gave us. Specifically, the committee was apprehensive of (l) picking\nup classroom lectures, (2) certain titles heavily oriented toward military\nuse and possibly not of general interest. Of the latter, it seemed that\nPrograms 1, 7, 11, and 12 might be of less interest to civilian listeners.\nAll of us, of course, fully realize that you can likely defend these\nmatters quite adequately, and that you would be willing to submit a\nsample program. I strongly suggest that you do this, sending such tap©\nto me or to Dr. Harry Skornia at NAEB headquarters. 1 will see that it\ngets to the sub-committees on planning and on acceptance without delay.\nMany thanks for submitting the idea to us; it certainly has genuine\nmerit and I hope the series can be broadcast on the network.\nSincerely,\nKenneth D, bright\nDirector of Broadcasting\nChairman, Sub-Committee on\nNetwork Radio Program Planning\nKD»« i ss"
