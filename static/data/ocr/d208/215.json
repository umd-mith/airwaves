Obviously, if the networks are going to start compet¬\ning with us on our own terms, we've got to be good.'\nFour-just because we’re a booming, growing industry with an ever wider in¬\nfluence on our collective community, let’s not be complacent. And\nabove all, let’s avoid that ’’Ivory Tower” attitude like the plague.\nWe must never forget our obligation to orient the listener, and show\nhim how the things we have to offer can be rewarding to him in terms\nof his everyday life.\nIn short, we have a great future, ard an exciting future. But we can’t just coast\nalong on worthy objectives and lofty principles. We’ve got to keep working toward\nconstantly improving our end product.\nAs given at 1953 National Convention\nNorman, Oklahoma\nOctober 31, 1953"
