Anyway, you’ll get this sometime\nwhen the clouds dispel. Our Chicago meeting was pretty successful, I\nthink, and I’ll send you complete records of it within a few weeks.\nMeantime, perhaps you cen help us. You wrote me originally about\nthe possibility of some Shakespeare from Antioch College and I talked\nto the comnittee about this. I have seen five antioch productions while\nsummering at Ohio State, and can vouch for their merit. But somehow the\nmaterial on it at National Headquarters of the NAEB, if indeed they ever\nhad any, has been lost. Could you tell us how to get more, or send\nsame to me if you happen to have anything? Perhaps there never was any**\nthing, but I get the impression that some sort of proposal has been\nreceived and lost. 'Ye’d like to look into it further for next summer,\nso need to get started at once.\nGood holidays to you.\nSincerely,\nKDWj ss\nKenneth D. Wright\nDirector of Broadcasting"
