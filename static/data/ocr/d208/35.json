  "text": "The first President’s Highway Conference, in 1946, worried about\nthe accident exposure generated by some 35.000,000 motor vehicles. Now\nit is necessary to cope with the hazards created by 54,000,000 vehicles.\nThe Solution\nThere is no longer any question of what to do. The knowledge is\navailable — accumulated in thirty years of study and experience by pub¬\nlic officials and private organizations. The Action Program developed\nby the 1946 and 1950 President's Conferences covers the fields of edu¬\ncation, engineering, accident records, motor vehicle administration,\nenforcement, laws and ordinances, and public information and support.\nEffectiveness of this program has been demonstrated by the fact\nthat those States and communities, which have most faithfully followed\nthe recommendations, have sharply reduced their accident tolls. Largely\nthrough partial application of the Action Program, the national fatali¬\nty rate per hundred million vehicles has been reduced more than one-\nthird since the program was developed in 1946.\nYet, these advances have been achieved with only spotty and fre¬\nquently haphazard effort. Nation-wide, there has never been carried\nout more than 60 percent of what might be termed the minimum recommended\nprogram.\nThe Opportunity\nFollowing last June's White House meeting, the business group\nset a goal for 1954: to reduce the Nation-wide highway toll by 40 per-¬\ncent. This would mean at least 15,000 lives saved, and 5^0,000 spared\nfrom injury, including 40,000 kept from being permanently maimed."
