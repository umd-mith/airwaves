Nevertheless, I know of the high record in which he\nis held by so many members of the NAEB* On that basis I would\nsuggest that a series of thirteen 15-minute programs be planned\nwith approximately four programs for each of the sub-headings\nset forth in Starlin’s letter*\nIf an expanded series of any one of these three\nsubjects seems warranted it could be planned for the future. In\nother words, these thirteen programs would be an omnibus package\nwith the MORALIST, PURITANISM and EDUCATION tonics as sub-series.\nWith all best wishes.\nCordially yours.\nBernard R.
