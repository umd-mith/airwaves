We shall be most happy to serve as the focal point for educa*-\ntional broadcasters in this regard.\nIn this connection, I wonder if it might be possible for you to pre¬\npare one-minute announcements that we could distribute to our members\non a considerably more varied basis than that included in your sample.\nWe shall also include in our Newsletter material on this Centennial\nwhich will help all our local members to devise local ways in which\nto help you observe your anniversary.\nIn this connection also, has any thinking been done on the possibility\nwhich you and I never got to discuss, but which I believe Belmont\nFarley and Frank Schooley talked about at some length one day? We\ndo want to make ourselves as useful as possible and only need the more\nspecific thinking which will enable us to carry on.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director\nHJSscr\nEnc.\nDictated by Dr. Skomia May 2k}\nbut signed and mailed in his absence.\nCCt Mr. Frank Schooley"
