For the people in countries under Communist domina¬\ntion, VOA provides one of the few remaining links with the outside world and\na continuing source of hope and encouragement o For the free world, it brings\na closer understanding of the people and international policies of the United\nStates*\nThe Voice of America — a part of the UoS* Information Agency — is a\npowerful instrument for international understanding * Its broadcasts, now\nheard in 3U languages and dialects, total approximately 28 hours and 200,000\nwords a day* Its massage is projected to a global audience over a far-flung\nnetwork of about 80 stations* Its domestic transmitters are spotted across\nthe United States in the New York, Cincinnati, and San Francisco areas* More\nthan half of its transmitters are in distant locations — England, Mum,eh, Tangier\nSalonika, Rhodes, Luzon Island in the Philippines, Okinawa, Honolulu, and\nCeylon* At some of these overseas locations, VOA programs are picked up by\nvery sensitive receivers and boosted in power by high-power short wave trans¬\nmitters* At some of the stations, the programs are rebroadcast also on the\n\"standard broadcast band\" which the simplest radio can pick up.\nVOA’s million-watt transmitters commissioned in 19!?3S at Munich, Luzon,\nand Okinawa are the most powerful known broadcasting stations in the world*\nThey are many times stronger than the largest commercial station in the\nUnited States and twice as powerful as Radio Moscow* Another important addition"
