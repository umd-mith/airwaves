Kellogg Foundation\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Maurice:\nJune 30th brought to a close eleven years of Kellogg support for the\nNAEB an association marked, I believe, by mutual professional and personal\nrespect and regard.\nThe initial grant enabling NAEB to establish a headquarters office and set\nup the Tape Network, launched the Association into a new era of expanded\nservice and professional operation; the continuing Kellogg Foundation support\nenabled us to strengthen and consolidate these gains and lay the groundwork\nfor affording continuing service and growth. It is this unique support which\nhas made it possible for NAEB to command increasing respect and recognition\nnationally and internationally each year. No single development in the history\nof NAEB has had so affirmative an impact.\nAnd, over the course of more than a decade, you and your associates have\nbeen sympathetic and understanding, listening to our trials and tribulations,\nputting up with our foibles and follies. For this, too, we are grateful.\nIt is our conclusion, in which we hope you share, that through its generous\nsupport of NAEB, the WJC. Kellogg Foundation has helped in a very positive way\nto help insure that the benefits of the electronic media are used increasingly\nto the greater dignity, integrity and efficiency of American education and our\nsociety •\nIn all sincerity, we of NAEB want to express again our lasting gratitude and\nabiding appreciation.\nSincerely yours,\nWGH:pw\nWilliam G. Harley\nP JS. A final financial statement and the annual report will be along shortly."
