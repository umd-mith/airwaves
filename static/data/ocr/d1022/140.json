Some insects are helpful$ others are harmful.\nThere are many, many kinds of insects. Insects have three distinct body\nparts — head, thorax, and abdomen — and most adult insects have one or two\npairs of wings. Many insects go through metamorphosis — four distinct stages of\ndevelopment: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Larvae are called caterpillars,\nmaggots, and grubs. Some insects spend part of their life cycle in water.\nInsects such as bees, ants, wasps, and termites have a very complicated social\norganization. Some insects, like bees, are helpful in the pollination of plants^\nothers are harmful in the destruction they cause, as parasites, and in carrying\ndisease. .\nThings to Do;\n1. Make a study of an insect society, such as ants or bees.\n2. Collect samples of the different stages of insect life — eggs, larvae, pupae,\nand adults. Examine under a magnifying glass.\n3. Find out how environmental factors affect the metamorphosis of insects.\nSources:\n1. Craig - Science for the Elementary School Teachers\n2. Duncan - Insects as Enemies and Benefactors of Man\n3.
