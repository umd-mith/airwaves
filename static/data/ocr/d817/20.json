These three, on law,\nbusiness, and medicine, are not necessarily the best that the network\nhopes to obtain in the future* The chairman has communicated with\nnumerous stations asking for submission of five-minute programs currently\nin production and stimulating others to produce such programs in\nneeded areas* It is hoped that new series of a newsworthy nature will\nbe forthcoming in the areas of science, literature, the theater, the\nUnited Nations, etc* It is too early to judge the acceptability of five-\nminut© programs by network stations. If interest in such programs wanes,\nthey will be discontinued*\nIn March the network began experimenting with a new system of\ndistributing \"specials.\" These specials at the moment fall into three\ncategories: 1) documentaries, lecture#, etc* of indeterminate length\nbut timely in nature, offered and distributed whenever available at the\ndiscretion of the Network Manager (an example being the VOA program on\nCastro \"Anatomy of & Broken Promise\"); 2) \"Washington Report,\" a 15-\nminute commentary program recorded in Washington; and 3) a half-hour\n\"Special of the Week\" edited from tapes supplied chiefly by the VOA in\nWashington*\nLen Press, serving as program coordinator in Washington, was\ninstrumental In setting up the machinery for the weekly \"Washington\nReports\" and has summarized his problems elsewhere*\nTo expedite preparation and distribution of the \"Specials of the\nWeek\" it was arranged that taped material suitable for the series, whether\nit came from the VOA or member sources, would be shipped to WHOM for\naudition and packaging* This procedure has worked satisfactorily* The\nspeakers who have been heard on these programs include President"
