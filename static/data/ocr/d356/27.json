I asked what figures they thought we should consider for offering our\nown publications, telling them the regular subscription rates and the amount\nof a $10 Individual Membership allotted for each, and suggesting that such\nreduced rates should fall somewhere in between. Several did not answer this\npart, but those who did suggest the following:\nJournal: $4, $4,50 (2 suggested this), $4.75, and $5.\nNewsletter: $3, $3.25, $3.35, $3.75, and $4.\nWashington Report: $1.25, $1.50, $1.75 (2), and $2.\nI hope this gives you the help you were seeking from the committee.\nBest,\n(Mrs.) Betty McKenzie\nPublications Editor\nBMCK/mp"
