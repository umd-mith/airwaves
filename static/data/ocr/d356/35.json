Bell, Director\nRadio and Television\nUniversity of Colorado\nBoulder, Colorado\nDear Mr. Belli\nAs you may have forgotten by this time, when Colby Lewis asked\nfor suggestions for articles and authors for the Journal. you\noffered several good suggestions. One was an article on over¬\nseas assignments in STV-Radio, to be written by someone in the\nNAEB office.\nEnclosed are photocopies of the correspondence between me and\nHarold Hill and Jim Fellows. Can you elaborate further for them\non what you have in mind?\nSo far I haven*t received articles on your other two very fine\nsuggestions either. However, I haven't received a \"no* from\nShayon either, which is encouraging.\nAs to Fredette and “Why NAEB Individual Membership,* if I don't\nhear from him pretty soon I shall take you up on your kind offer\nto write it. However, it would be nice, as you suggested, if he,\nas chairman of the Individual Member Board for some time, would\nwrite it.\nThanks for your help. And best wishes for the rest of 1965•\nSincerely,\nMrs. Betty McKenzie\nPublications Editor\nBMCK/mp\nEnclosures (2)\nu\n001 Mr. Harold E# Hill\nMr. James Fellows\ny\nV"
