If so,\nwhy not do so?\nIt seems this document should be distributed as\nyou suggest (with a request for rapid reaction).\nAfter reviewing the comments from the various groups,\na course of action should be formulated and imple¬\nmented by the association staff.\nThe channel of communication between NAEB and the\nCommission should continue unchanged.\nIkl\ncc: William Harley"
