We may not hunger when they are\nunfed; but we all suffer the consequences of their mental and social\nimpoveris hmen t•\nRadio is the keystone of rural public communications. It can be\nsupplemented by television where there is enough population within the\ncoverage area; but in many parts of the Great Plains the population density\nis down to two persons per square mile. It can be supplemented by Telpak\n- most farm homes now have telephones; but not most country dwellers at large.\nLine and cable networks, with dial access to data centers, are needed too.\nSuch systems are proving to be vital in the planning for rural medical care\ndelivery systems. It is a necessity to locate vocational training at local\nsites, without requiring travel to distant centers. In the end, the com¬\nmunications grid serves government, law enforcement, education, rural area\norganization and development - all major phases of community life, and all\nvital channels of communication with the isolated rural or farm family.\nIn a matter of months, communications satellites will be over the\nEastern and Western halves of this country. At least two channels will be\ndevoted to public and educational use - IF we are ready to use them. There\nmust be ground systems ready to utilize their signals, to store and relay them."
