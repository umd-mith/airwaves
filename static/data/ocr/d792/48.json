These programs are produced for the\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters with the cooperation\nof Radio Italians.\nBefore I came to Italy a couple of months ago friends told me\nthat this time I might find a strong anti-American feeling, particularly\nin Rome. They said I should be prepared for this i that Italy, and\nespecially Home, might not be as friendly and accommodating as I had\nfound them on previous visits.\nThat anti-Americanism may exist. It probably does exist in some\ncircles and in some measure. After all, the Italians have experienced\nwhat one might call two American invasions in the last ten years. The\nfirst one was military and the second one was everything else: a tourist\ninvasion; an invasion of American economic experts in the Marshall Plan\ndays; invasions of Congressional investigating teams; and what some would\ncall a kind of cultural Invasion that includes everything from movies\nand Coca Cola and dinger sewing machines to artists and writers and\nvisiting professors.\nBo, I say, that anti-Americanism may exist. But I haven't found\nit. The only major evidence of anti-American feeling I have seen was\nthat displayed in the student demonstrations and riots over the Trieste\nviolence, which I talked about in a previous Letter from Italy. And\nthe British caught that attack worse than we did. In any event. It\nsoon died down and the anti-American part of it was quickly forgotten.\nwhat I have found in Italy that directly concerns Americans is\nsomething that I believe is more Important; has more longrange signifies*#\ncanoe than these surface evidences of anti-Americanism that I was\nsupposed to find."
