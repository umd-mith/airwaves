  "text": "Hovey — 4\nWorking at odd jobs all the while, young Pella completed the work\nfor his diploma in accounting at 18 and took his degree in economics\nand commerce from the University of Turin at 22.\nThen he took a teaching job in a technical school at Biella, but\nsimultaneously launched an independent professional career as a business\nconsultant*\nWhat happened immediately after that really is straight out of\nHoratio Alger. A few years after taking his university degree, Pella\nwas consultant to the most substantial Industries in his home city of\nBiella* Before he was 30 he had as clients the main textile industries\nof north Italy.\nIt has been said that from about 1930 until the outbreak of World\nWar II there was no important European conference of woolen manufacturers\nwhich Pella did not attend.\nWhile establishing himself in business, Pella apparently put aside\nan Interest in politics he had developed as a university student* He\nserved one term as vice-mayor of Biella in the mid-1930s, which indicates\nthat at that point he was not openly and mllitantly anti-Fasclst* But\nfriends say he did this out of civic duty to straighten out the communed\nfinances.\nThe Catholic bishop of Biella generally gets the credit for per¬\nsuading Pella to get into politics under the banner of the Christian\nDemocratic party after the war* Pella got the most votes in a Biella\ncity election in March, 1946, and was elected to the Italian constituent\nassembly that June*\nmore"
