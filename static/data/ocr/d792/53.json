It is a timely subject in\nthis Mediterranean part of the world because the United States has recent¬\nly concluded agreements for air and naval bases in Greece and Spain.\nIt may be hard for Americans to understand how deeply some Italian\ndemocrats resent the deal made with Franco Spain. First of all, Spain is\nstill on the conscience of western European democrats because Franco came\nto power with the help of Mussolini and Hitler in the days when the\ndemocracies were attempting to appease fascism. Secondly, the European,\nwho knows modem war first-hand, is very sensitive Indeed to the sugges¬\ntion that bases in Spain are needed because it might be necessary to hold\nthe Russians at the Pyrenees barrier in any future conflict. Europeans —\nIncluding Italians — feel that if they had to be liberated after first\nbeing overrun by the Russian army there would not be much to liberate.\nIet*0 take one example of Italian reaction to the Spanish bases\ntransaction, from the Liberal weekly newspaper, II Mondo, which many\nItalians will tell you is the best thing in Italian Journalism.
