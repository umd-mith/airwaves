Maes\nDeputy Executive Director\nFundacion Creole\nApartado 889\nCaracas, Venezuela\nDear Mr. Maes:\nlour letter is one of several which raise the question of consultation\nassistance and other relations we might provide for groups outside the.\nU. S. Since we do not have a procedure set up for this yet, I would like\nvery much to hold it for discussion at Board meetings at the end of this\nmonth. Would this delay inconvenience you too much?\nI am quite surej however, that we shall be able and willing to provide\nyou a list of consultants you need in general planning, programming, and.\ntechnical areas in some manner or another, subject of course to the working\nout of satisfactory arrangements. We already provide such consultation\nservices within the U. S., so there will be no difficulty in providing the\nbest qualified experts in virtually any area you need.\nIt would be helpful, however, if you could specify more exactly in what\nareas consultants would be needed, so the action taken by our Board to\nregularize such services may be as intelligent and broad as possible.\nSincerely,\nHJS/dfc\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director"
