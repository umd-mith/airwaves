We belong to 400,000 organizations,\ncovering every cause, every interest, every need\nof our way of life.\nIn the past twenty years, business and profes¬\nsional associations have multiplied faster than\neither the population or the number of business\nenterprises. With this expansion has come an\neven greater need for trained executive leadership\nof these organized groups.\nSince 1920, when the American Society of\nAssociation Executives was formed, the manage¬\nment of voluntary groups, especially those of\nbusiness, industry and the professions, has de¬\nveloped and kept pace with the tremendous\ngrowth. The Society's membership has grown\nfrom the original twenty-two founders to its\npresent strength of nearly 2,500 members.\nIt is no longer possible for the untrained,\nunskilled person to manage an association suc¬\ncessfully. There are too many problems, too\nmany opportunities for failure — and failure\nwithin an association can bring disaster to an\nentire industry. ASAE provides the professional\nassociation executive with the means to turn\npossible failure into success."
