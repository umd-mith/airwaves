HILL VICE PRESIDENT\nJanuary 22, 1965\nMiss Marion Corwell\nAssociate Director\nDearborn Public Schools\n4824 Lois\nDearborn, Michigan 48126\nDear Marion:\nI haven’t reacted to the exchange of correspondence between you and\nLee Campion prior to now, because I thought Lee might drop into the\noffice early this week, as he indicated in his letter, and we could\nthen discuss the matter. Apparently, his schedule was too tight for\nhim to come by, so I’ll now write.\nBill Harley, Jim Fellows and I have discussed this project and think\nthe idea has merit and that Lee has proposed a simple way to proceed.\nHowever, we have a couple of major reservations.\nFirst, we wonder whether the use of the information would justify the\nexpense in printing the nice little booklet that would be required to\nget the information out. Our thought is that it would not receive very\nwidespread use, because those most interested in speakers (PTA, school\nboards, service clubs, AA.WU, etc.) are normally in a position to merely\npick up the phone and call a friend in the business or one who knows\nsomeone who is.\nSecond, we are a little leary of giving the impression that we are\nendorsing those whose names appear in the booklet. This might be\nespecially bad, if, as we fear, the ones wanting their names listed\ntend to be actually the least qualified.\nThis doesn't close the door, obviously, but we did want you to know our\nreactions.\nHarold E. Hill\nHEH/smj\ncc: Mr. Lee Campion"
