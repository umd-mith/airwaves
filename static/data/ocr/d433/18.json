I dislike alibis and I won't\nbore you with all of the reasons why I have not been able\nto meet your deadline date for ideas about compiling our\nNAEB SPEAKER'S DIRECTORY. The past two weeks have just\nbeen too demanding and yours was one assignment which I put\naside. Now I am leaving for DAVI in Denver where I will be\nmost of next week. After that you will be in Philadelphia\nat AWRT. I, unfortunately, am going to have to miss it but\nwhile you are conventioning I will do my best to prepare\nsomething and have it in your mail by the time you return\nto Dearborn. I hope to be at the Columbus Institute and\nthink by all means that we ought to get our committee to plan\nto meet there.\nWith best wishes, I am,\n(Mrs.) Gertrude G. Broderick\nEducational Media Specialist"
