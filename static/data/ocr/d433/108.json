Haney\nDirector\nOffice of Instructional Resources\nUniversity of Illinois\nNavy Pier\nChicago 11, Illinois\nDear John:\nI don’t know what happened but for some strange reason I am\njust now getting around to your letter of October 20.\nI believe, although I am willing to listen to argument, that\nthe University of Illinois-Chicago will have to join the NAEB\nas a separate entity. The only precedent we really have for\nthis is a similar situation with the University of Minnesota\nbranch in Duluth which operates a radio station and which we\nrequire to take out a membership in addition to the one held\nby the University of Minnesota.\nI realize there may be differences, primarily the fact that\nthe U. of Minn.-Duluth wanted to get programs from our network,\nand thus had to join separately. The problem, really, is that\nwe have no way of adding you to the Instructional Division mail¬\ning list unless the U. of I.-Chicago becomes a separate member.\nI’m afraid if we did allow this, this would set a precedent\nwhich would cause Innumerable problems.\nAs I say, I am willing to hear arguments on the other side so\nlet me have your reactions to this letter, along with any\nother ideas or suggestions you might make.\nCordially,\nHarold E. Hill\nHBH/mlm"
