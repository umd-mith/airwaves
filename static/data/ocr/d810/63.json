INDIANA\nRadio and Television Service\nFebruary 11, 1956\nMr. 0-eorge Jennings\nBoard of Education\nChicago 1, Illinois\nDear G-eorge:\nI received the copies of the January issue of the JOURNAL OF THE\nAERT with my article in it.\nI t:\nThank you very, very much. I have sent one copy to the manager of\n| Mexico’s educational station, XFUN, one copy to Cuba’s educational\n1 outlet, CMZ, and will send the others to similar broadcasters in\n| a few of the other Latin American republics. So the AERT name will\nj be ci culated where it can get more latinos interested in\nI our group here.\nI hope when it is convenient, you will send that film we discussed\nin person (dealing with use of equipment), so that my fledglings in\nbroadcast can see it.\nThanks again.\nBest wishes, and\nCordially,\n7^h4/\nMarvin Alisky\nAsst.
