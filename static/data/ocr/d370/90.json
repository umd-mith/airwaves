But, above all, the quality of education\ncould be greatly enhanced.\nIn a Research and Development program\nsuch as I have proposed, you members of the\neducational broadcasting fraternity could play\na vital role. For you have in your hands the\nmost potent means of communication between\neducators and the public. You can bring to\nyour own communities a vivid awareness of\nthe problem of quality and the means of\nsolving it.\nVI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nThe quality of education can be greatly up¬\ngraded by modern technology, while costs can\nbe lowered and the increase in students can be\ntaken care of at the same time.\nThe advent of new electronic tools, espe¬\ncially closed-circuit TV and its future deriva¬\ntives, makes possible an advance in methods\nof education comparable to that made possible\nby the invention of the printing press in the\nFifteenth Century.\nIndeed, it is an advance which can be even\ngreater than the development of the atomic\n13"
