An Astro-Electronic Products Division was created\nto develop and produce earth satellites, space vehicles and associated\nelectronic equipment.\nIn two years, under Mr. Burns* leadership, the non-enter¬\ntainment aspects of RCA's business increased by more than 30 per cent.\nIn the past year alone the company introduced 100 new products, from\nthimble-sized vacuum tubes to giant radars. During 1959 it is ex¬\npected that RCA * s new products list will grow to nearly 400.\nMr. Burns speaks of the future of electronics with vision¬\nary zeal and enthusiasm. He sees electronic \"brains\" operating en¬\ntire factories in the not-too-distant future. He foresees satellite\ncommunications systems that will bring about a world-wide television\nnetwork.\nTurning to education, he suggests that televised classes\nwill he^P solve the teacher shortage and bring the world's best\nteachers into the smallest and most remote school rooms.\n\"There is no technical reason,\" he says, \"why all schools\nthroughout the country could not be tied together in one vast educa¬\ntional network to take advantage of television's magic gift for\nthrusting millions of spectators at once into the lap of history-in-\nthe-making.\"\nAs for the home of tomorrow, that will be an electronic\nmiracle too. Mr. Burns envisions a \"household electronic center\"\nwhere a few simple controls will set up the family schedule for each\nday. The electronic housekeeper will rouse us from sleep in the\nmorning, close the windows, cook breakfast, open the garage doors."
