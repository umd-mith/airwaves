Burns\nPresident\nRadio Corporation of America\nAt Institute for Education by Radio-TV\nOhio State University\nColumbus, April 28, 1961\nEDUCATIONAL TV: A BLUEPRINT FOR ACTION\nI have written and talked so much about educational television\nlately that I feel a kinship with the Harvard psychologist who overheard a\nconversation among the white mice in his laboratory. The smartest and\nplumpest of the mice was boasting: \"I've got this fellow so conditioned that\nall I have to do is press a button and he feeds me. \"\nWhen my button was pressed for this speech, I experienced\nthe same conditioned reflex of acceptance that the words educational television\nhave always stirred in me. What we need is more, not less, talk about the\npromise of educational TV, and about the urgency of using it to solve our\nparamount national problem."
