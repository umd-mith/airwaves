A final proposal would of course spell out various\naspects much more fully, particularly in respect to details of\nthe specialised projects and their budgets.\nWe hope the suggestions advanced herein are in accord with\nthe Foundation's current interests and, as such, will warrant\nfurther discussion. I will be glad to come up to New York at\nany time to talk with you.\nSincerely yours.\nWGH:ce\nEnclosure\nWilliam G. Harley"
