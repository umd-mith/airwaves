The major techni¬\ncal facts of life in etv are:\nCircuitry—etv is transmitted\neither by closed- or open-circuit\nsystems. Closed-circuit television\nusually operates over cables, like\nthe telephone. Since it does not send\npicture and sound through the air,\nclosed-circuit television requires\nno allocation of television channels\nand is outside the jurisdiction of\nthe F. C.C. It reaches only so far as\nits cables reach. The most exten¬\nsive system of closed-circuit teach¬\ning by television is at Hagerstown,\nMaryland, where most of the\nschools in an entire county are\nlinked by cable. The principal\ndrawbacks to closed-circuit sys-\nHagerstown, Maryland, points proudly to its his¬\ntory as a famous wagon stop on the National\nRoad, now U. S. 40; as home of Gruber’s Hag¬\nerstown Almanac, three years older than the\nFarmer’s Almanac; as first to fluoridate its water\nsystem; and as the site of fine schools and a pipe-\norgan factory. Since September, 1956, perhaps its\nmost widely known civic attraction has been ETV.\nHagerstown is the center of the Washington\nCounty Closed-Circuit Educational Television\nProject. The most intensively developed in-sehool\ntelevision system in the United States, it draws\nabout 2,500 visitors a year from every state and\ncontinent — teachers, school administrators, jour¬\nnalists, technicians, and the plain curious. A full¬\ntime official had to be hired to handle visitors and\nrequests for information. ETV workshops are\nconducted for teachers from other school systems.\nHagerstown school personnel are in demand to\nspeak throughout the country, and School Super¬\nintendent William M. Brish visited India as a\nconsultant on introducing televised instruction\nin secondary education.\nAs a showplace for ETV, Hagerstown is both\ntypical and atypical. No school system’s ETV\nprogram has been so heavily subsidized. The\nFord Foundation and the Fund for the Advance¬\nment of Education have made grants totaling\n$1,173,910. Television and telephone companies\nhave contributed more than $300,000 worth of\nequipment. New ETV teaching devices, like those\nshown below, have been born at Hagerstown."
