  "text": "-2-\nIII* Objectives, l) To gather and evaluate technical information on\ntypical installations now making effective use of radio and television\nsystems for instructional purposes, 2) To make this information readily\navailable to educators, administrators and educational broadcasters so as\nto stimulate the use of radio and television in teaching. 3) To make\npossible the proper choice of equipment so that, once acquired and\ninstalled, it will accomplish its mission with a maximum of quality,\nflexibility and durability, and a minimum of technical problems, obso¬\nlescence, upkeep or revision expense. The FCC through its licensing pro¬\ncedure for both radio and television broadcasting stations sets standards\nfor good engineering practice; however no standards exist for non-broadcast\nequipment in these fields. This project would contribute greatly to the\nestablishment of such standards.\nIV. Other Related Research. A number of books have been published on radio\nand television equipment. However most of these cover technical aspects\nof the equipment and do not provide data on costs or specific installations >\nMost technical society journals also cover design considerations of equip¬\nment. While some information has been published in educational journals ,\nthe best source on specific installations is ’’Broadcast News’1, a promotional\npublication of an equipment manufacturer. As a result of this lack of da+a\nin objective, non-technical form, most institutions contemplating entering\nfoe field send a representative to visit one or more operating installation-.’,\nand with the assistance of equipment catalogs, plan their own plant. Floor\nIans, block diagrams, and schematics of existing installations based on\nmlid experimentation and evaluation, as proposed her , would o;;:co singly\nh -upful tc them in making such plans."
