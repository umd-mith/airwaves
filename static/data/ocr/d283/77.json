  "text": "January 7, 1959\nDr. Maurice F. Seay, Director\nDivision of Education\nVIs# K. Kellogg Foundation\n250 Champion Street\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Maurice:\nIn response to your letter of January 5, I shall explain informally and unoffi¬\ncially in this letter the various membership classifications. In addition,\nI'm attaching a slightly longer description which includes the definitions of\nthe four main categories listed, as defined in our constitution. Our last two\nannual reports also provided some data on growth.\nPresently we have:\n1) 142 active members: institutions which have their own radio or\ntelevision transmission facilities (stations).\n2) 100 associate members: institutions with studios and regular\nschedules of broadcasts (as well as, since October, 1958,\nclosecf circuit TV educational installations), but no trans¬\nmitters .\n3) 63 affiliates: institutions or organizations engaged or\ninterested in doing or promoting educational broadcasting.\nThis includes many schools which don't yet qualify for\neither active (with transmitter) or associate (regular sched¬\nules) memberships.\n4) 321 individual members — a category which didn't exist until\nsome two and one-half years ago. The category to which\nwe now are devoting much of our attention and effort. In¬\nherited upon the demise of the Association by Radio and\nTelevision, January 1, IS57.\n5) 3 honorary: 2 former FCC commissioners friendly to education\nand Miss Judith Waller, NBC education director for many\nyears."
