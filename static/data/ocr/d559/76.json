Sulzer, Director\nRadio-TV Communications\nIndiana university\nBloomington, Indiana\n|718| 8{i0|l' \\ j i%\\ 1 $ #1 ^iY\nDear Bromor\nHarold and I had a brainstorm that maybe it would be a\ngood idea for the NAEB PR committee to line up \" contact people’* at\nuniversities sponsoring summer workshops (as listed in the Newsletter).\nThese contact people would then distribute to the attendees NAEB\npropaganda, such as Fast Sheet indexes (from which we get a number of\norders for Fact Sheets themselves), our membership flyers, and other\nbrochures.\nWe would ship the needed items from here to the contact person.\nWhat do you think?\nNow to Hank Mamet's very excellent letteri The community workshops\nidea I leave for someone wiser in the field than I. I honestly don't\nknow whether it would do much for the NASB or not.\nYes, we have the descriptive brochure he mentions—a quite small,\neasily read thing. I enclose a copy in case you haven't seen it or have\nforgotten it.\nAwards I tend to agree with you on...and without a lot of work, this in\nitself wouldn't stimulate too much interest in the NAEB, in my opinion.\nFor the \"special” magazine we're issuing in September, do you think\nthere is anyone who could do a better article on station promotion than\nwas done by you in the booklet—or even one half as good? Also, the\narticle by Tom Petry back in the March-Aprll, 1960, Journal. If you\nhave any ideas along that line, I'd like to Investigate the possibili¬\nties. Best regards.\n(Mrs) Be e\nPublications Editor\nbmck/ea"
