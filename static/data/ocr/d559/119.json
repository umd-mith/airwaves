Hill\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n13i*6 Connecticut Avenue, N,¥,\nWashington 6, D.C.\nt\nDear Harold:\nYour memo of August 25th regarding the committee meetiigs reminded me\nthat the Public Relations Committee should have a meeting sometime\nduring the convention. Since I would like you and Betty to attend\nthe meeting and because of your special interest in our function,\nwhich I appreciate, how about your setting up a time for this event\nand letting me know? Thereupon I will notify the other members of\nour committee. A few days ago, I sent Betty copies of the NAB speech\npackets, and if she can come up with an estimate by the time of\nour meeting and you have an idea as to how much can be spent for the\npurpose, I hope we can make a decision. Marion Corwell and I have\nbeen in quite a bit of correspondence regarding this matter, and she\nis as enthusiastic as I. In fact, I am going to have a conference\nwith Marion in Indianapolis on September 29th in connection with an\narea AWRT meeting scheduled to begin on that date*\nI know that this is a heck of a time to propose the matter, but it\nseems to me that a seminar session on \"Educational Station Public\nRelations\" would not have been out of place at the convention. I\nsuppose it is too late to think of this now, or is it?\nLooking forward to seeing you in Washington, I\nEGS:vz\ncc: Mrs. Betty McKenzie\nElmer G. Sulzer, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\nP.S. Don*t schedule the PR Committee meeting for a Monday morning\nbreakfast session, as we intend to arrive in Washington by\n\"The Spirit of St. Louis\", which is scheduled for arrival at\n8:00 a.m. or thereabouts."
