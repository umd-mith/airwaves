Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nNAEB k\n1U Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr. Hills\nIn addition to the matter of the SPEAKERS GUIDE, I have another item\nthat I would like our committee to take on as a project. Again I am\ncopying an activity of the NAB.\nI recently received from the NAB Public Relations Service two compre¬\nhensive folders titled respectively, \"Radio Public Relations Aids\" and\n\"Television Public Relations Aids\". These folders are issued primarily\nas indoctrination materials for new stations as they join the NAB, and\nI believe that something similar would be invaluable not only for our\nnew NAEB members but also for our older ones.\nI have only single copies of these publications, but since you are in\nWashington, you are in a good position to secure copies for yourself\nand Betty. I am having a conference with Marion Corwell the latter\npart of this month in Indianapolis, and at that time I will show her\nthe copies I have.\nBest regardsl\nRadio and Television Communications\nEGS/mp\ncc:\nMrs. Betty McKenzie\nMiss Marion Corwell\nMr. Thomas Petry"
