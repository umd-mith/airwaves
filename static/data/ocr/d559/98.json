Since some of the papers to idiom\nthese should go have received a Newsletter in which the eommlttee\nmembers were listed, it might be gHMng ^ lily to issue *n@vs«\nreleases now* X do think the idea is a good one and will follow\nthrough on it with the new year unless otherwise directed*\nI also think the idea of Marlon* s of printing in the newsletter\nfeature articles defining the duties and function of NAEB committees\nis a good on© and will see what X can do in this regard*\nRegarding the Speaker’s Guide, this too seems like a fine suggestion\nbut the go-ahead on this will have to come from Harold because, as\nyou gather, this on© would cost money*\nThank you for the compliment on my work*\nBest regards,\n(Mrs*) Betty McKenzie\nPublications Editor\nBMJ/dp\ncot Miss Merlon Coryell /\nMr* Harold E* Hill y/"
