Hill\nAdministrative Vice President, NAEB\n13U6 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Harold:\n1*11 say my letter was confusing. The correct price for\nthe slides, single copy, should be $10.60 per dozen or\n$30 for fifty. If more than one copy were to be used for\nthese slides, let us say two different copies, the price\nfor twelve of each would be twice $10.60, etc. Hope this\nmakes everything clear.\nCordi\nElmervG.
