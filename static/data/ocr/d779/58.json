Belden mike cable #8422 ® .08 .48\n2- test slips .40\n1-Bound notebook for maintenance notes 1.00\nWe should also have in addition to the above:\nl-D-110 Test Tape 7| IPS $12.50\n1-D-lll Test Tape 15 IPS 17.50\nl-D-500 Test Indicator 3.95\n$33.95\nWith these tapes we can check - wow and flutter,\nhead alignment, frequency response signal to noise ratio,\nmaximum signal level and tape speed (timing). These\nwould be for NAEB Headquarters use only. From The\nDubbings Co., 41-10 45th Street, Long Island City 4,\nN. Y.\nTo make things easier on the tape network budget,\npossibly the Volt-ohm Milliameter and the test tapes\nand test indicator could be bought from Engineering\nFunds. This would involve the expenditure of possibly\n$100 of Tape Network funds (estimating $1500 for the\nplayback head and $10.00 each for recording heads) and\nthe balance covering test equipment and tapes of approxi¬\nmately $75.00 from FAE funds if you think we could legiti¬\nmately charge this* to FAE. WILL has a $287.00 tube checker\nwhich we can use also the audio oscillator and distortion\nmeter \"sold” to them; however, these are required only\noccasionally.\nCecil S. Bidlack\nCSB:cp"
