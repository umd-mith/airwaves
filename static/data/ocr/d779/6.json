Network Headquarters (as distinguished from NAEB National Headquarters)\nhas five full-time workers, the equivalent of one of whom does the desk work in¬\nvolved* Obviously, this is inadequate bo the present still-expanding operation*\nThe Network Headquarters therefore recommends that additional help be made avail¬\nable as needed* In the meantime, one half-time vjorkor will be moved from physical\nto clerical work, and Network Headquarters will attempt to male© use of NAEB Head¬\nquarters9 clerical personnel*\nBut the most helpful advance that could be made—and we consider this the main\npoint of this report—would be a careful, realistic redefinition of Station-Network^\ncommittee relationships and responsibilities and an insistence on orderly standard¬\nized procedure by all parties* This redefinition should be complete down to \"who\nwrites what letters*” Standard procedure cannot comprehend every conceivable sit¬\nuation, of course, but it can and should be made to comprehend the greater part of\nthem*\n| ■\nTo help this redefinition, the Network submits the following suggestions, which will\nbe considered activated unless countermanded*\nSTATIONS must submit an adequate number of Program Submission Forms for each pro¬\ngram or series they wish the NAEB to consider for possible distribution over the\nNetwork* (Six copies for programs submitted for the Network Acceptance Committees\neight copies for programs submitted for the In-School Program committee*) Stations\nare responsible for the complete editing of programs for general distribution and\nwill have edited programs at Network Headquarters at least five weeks before they\nare to be r ©leased on the air* (The In-School Program Committee has in the past\nsaid that editing of their programs for Network distribution was unnecessary be¬\ncause stations would edit them in adapting them to their own use*) See Appendix B\nfor Program Format Requirements*\nTHE NETWORK ACCEPTANCE COMMITTEE and THE IN-SCHOOL PROGRAM COMMITTEE will decide\nthe acceptance and rejection of all programs except those which are in any way so\ntimely as to render committee action impossible or those to which the Network is\ncommitted through other authorized agents* In the former cases the decision must\nbe left to the Executive Director of NAEB and /or the Network Manager*\nCommittee votes should be submitted to the r espective chairman who will forward the\nresults to the Network Manager* Whether letters of acceptance or rejection should\nbe handled by the committee chairman, the Network manager, or the Executive Direc¬\ntor is debatable* It is the opinion of the Network manager that these letters\nshould proceed from the committee chairmen, who can write them as impersonal conaai-\ntee form-reports* If they are to be sent from Headquarters, the chairmen should\nrender explicit committee decisions and any evaluations should be advanced as im¬\npersonal, quotable committee reports*\nWhen submissions involve such large quantities of tapes as t> render the submission\nof great numbers of duplicated forms and tape recordings for individual committee\nmembers impractical, the chairman of the proper committee may call a meeting to\nreview the submission*\nNETWORK HEADQUARTERS will confine itself to its function as a distribution center"
