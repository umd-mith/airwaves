  "text": "-41-\nthe \"live adult teacher\" (the performer) is\nbeing tested against the effectiveness of puppets,\nsimulated animation (still drawings), and speech¬\nless animators (mimes). It is a frail premise\non which to spend close to ninety (90) thousand\ndollars, or on which to tie up the creative\nenergy of people who could possibly make a more\nsubstantial contribution with more effective\nguidance, or on which to involve the resources of\nat least two responsible research and production\noutlets.\nIt would seem as though these people had over¬\nlooked the rather extensive experiences in the\nuses of television in like situations. What is\ndistressing is the fact that funds were probably\nallocated for this and similar \"studies\", by other\nagencies. What is further unsettling is the fact\nthat the emphasis is unequally divided, between\nunderstanding children's responses to educational\ntelevision stimuli (the lesser emphasis) and the\nstudy of performer impact versus abstration\n(puppets, simulated animation, mimes, etc.),\nwhich, it seemed, accounted for the lion's share"
