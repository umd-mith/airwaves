I am, however, attaching\na copy of our most recent Consultation Report, so what we mean by this service\nwill at least be explicit in your own mind. If you’d ever like more detail on\nany of these, we’ll be glad to provide. We hope to have our usual report by\nearly September as well.\nSometime when I'm in New York I'd like to chat with you again. Do you live in\nthe city in case Tm able to make it only in evening time? I expect to be in\nNew York in early September for UNESCO National Commission Committee meetings.\nTaking the rest of my vacation the first two weeks of August* I hope you’ve had\nyours-—and a fine one.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director\nH7S:cmc\nEnclosure: Report, New Hampshire, Consultation Service\nCC: NAEB President F. E. Schooley /\nRichard B. Hull"
