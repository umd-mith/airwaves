The program was of such\nquality that it was- subsequently re-air\nlar local FM station.\nLater in the same month, we were planners and participants\nin a two-day national conference on \"THE MASS MEDIA AND\nURBAN TURBULENCE\" held at Wingspread,’ Racine, Wisconsin,\nunder sponsorship of the University and the Johnson Founda¬\ntion of Racine. Some conference sessions and some inter¬\nviews were taped and have since been aired.\nI Since March, WUWM has held monthly meetings at the Univer-\n| sity for Milwaukee radio and television newsmen and manage-\nfment, to determine a voluntary code of newscasting during\n| times of urban disturbance, as well as to establish con-\n| tacts enabling more extensive regular coverage of the\n| inner city. These meetings have been highly successful\n1 and will be continued."
