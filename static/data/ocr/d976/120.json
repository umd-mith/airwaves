This potential has not been fully realized, prin¬\ncipally because the past engineering Service grants have been on a year to\nyear basis which does not penult planning for long range and continuing\nprojects.\nThis request therefore is for funds to continue the present engineering\nService with its consultation and developmental assistance, and experimen¬\ntation , principally in television, but also in radio. This area of need\nis a continuing and Important one especially with the growing use of\nclosed circuit television for instructional purposes.
