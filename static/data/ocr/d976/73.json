Y., the Riverside Church\noutlet, and Jerrold Sandler, exec\ndirector of the National Educa¬\ntional Radio division of the Na¬\ntional Assn, of Educational Broad¬\ncasters. The proposal is the out¬\ngrowth of a study conducted for\nFord by Summerfield and Sandler\non the feasibility of establishing\n• public radio project. The non¬\ncommercial web would draw on\nthe program resources of both\nNET and PBL.\nRecently the Ford Foundation\ncommitted $500,000 to the cause*\nof public radio, but the money\nwas not allocated to any specific\nproject. Summerfield proposes that\nFold commit $750,000 for the\nPublic Radio NetWork. Foundation\nis expected to decide on the pro¬\nposal some fciimie in July, with\nbroadcast consultant Fred Friend¬\nly playing a key role in that de¬\ncision.\nThe proposed network would\nprobably function as an autono¬\nmous division of the National Edu¬\ncational Television and Radio\nCentre (NETRC), the legal, ^cor¬\nporate name for what is better\nknown as NET. Its relation to\nNETRC would be similar to that\nof the Children’s Television Work¬\nshop, an $8,000,000 project started\nin April by the Carnegie and Ford\nFoundations and the U.S. Dept,\nof Health, Education and Welfare.\nA national advisory committee\nwould not be concerned with spe¬\ncifics on a daily basis. The ad¬\nvisory committee, whose members\nwill not be drawn from PBL’s\nboard, would also function as part\nof NETRC.\nA Nightly Strip\nThe Public Radio Network is en¬\nvisioned by Summerfield as a 39-\nweek project, starting Oct, 1, and\nconsisting of a nightly (Monday-\nFriday) program ranging in length\nfrom 60 to 90 minutes. The full¬\ntime staff, numbering about 25\npeople, would work out of a pro¬\nduction centre in New York and a\npublic affairs bureau in Washing¬\nton. The series would feature a\nlarge group of experts and com¬\nmentators drawn from various\nfields. Who would serve in a mam j\nner similar to the guest pundits I\non ABC-TV's nightly newscast.\nSummerfield says it would not be\npossible to obtain network-calibre\ncommentators except on a con¬\ntributing basis. The practice of\nemploying parttime pundits is con¬\nceived as a solution to the per¬\nsonnel problem—the difficulty of\nattracting top-drawer journalistic\ntalent—that has plagued educa¬\ntional radio for some time.\nSummerfield says the public ra¬\ndio network would build on NET\nand PBL, using the same people\nand in some cases the same pro¬\ngramming involved in those en¬\ndeavors. For example, PBL chief\ncorrespondent Edward P. Morgan\nmight deliver a radio commentary\nseveral times a week, and NET\nreporter Paul Niven might also be\nheard. The stress would be on\nnews and comment with an exten¬\nsive use of actualities. Series\n| would have a cultural dimension,\n| which could include music (though\nnot full-length concerts) and\ndrama. Summerfield says there\nconceivably could be a BBC pro¬\nduction from the “World Theatre”\nseries or an adaptation of an off-\nB road way play.\nLive and Interconnected\nA live interconnect of about 50\nstations is envisioned, including\nthe stations of the Eastern Educa¬\ntional Radio Network. The latter\nare WRVR New York, WGBH Bos¬\nton, WAMC Albany, WFCR Am¬\nherst (Mass.), WAMU Washington,\nWUHY Philadelphia and WRFK\nRichmond. A midwestem network\nof the “big 10” educational institu¬\ntions in that area would expand\nthe coverage to a hoped-for cross¬\ncountry reach.\nThe Eastern Educational Radio\nNetwork stations had been inter¬\nconnected some years back but,\naccording to Summerfield, “tele¬\nphone line - bills killed us then.”\nHe would like to see the FCC set\nreduced rates for interconnection\nof non-commercial stations so that\nFord money could be spent mostly\non programming rather than to\npay AT&T bills.\nSummerfield, who will be exec\ndirector of the Public Radio Net¬\nwork and exec producer of the\nseries, assuming Ford approval,\nsays he hopes for residual broad¬\ncast rights to the sound portions\nof PBL or NET programs when\nsuitable for radio rebroadcast\n“Ovf matter” from the tv pro¬\ngrams might also be used, but the\nemphasis would be on radio-only\nmaterial.\nOne of the problems facing the\nproject is achieving harmony be¬\ntween the National Assn, of Edu¬\ncational Broadcasters and NETRC,\nwhich have often seemed at cross\npurposes. The NAEB operates a\ntape network (as opposed to a live\ninterconnect). Summerfield hopes\nto make available some outstand¬\ning PBL, NET and public radio\nprograms to the NAEB tape net¬\nwork. He would also like to see\nthe tape network headquarters\nshifted from the Univ. of Illinois\nto Washington, D.C., and has\nsought installation of new Ampex\nequipment iin the Capital to set up\na tape duplication centre there.\nOne of the projects Summer-\nfield is working on for the radio\nseries is a national dial-in for\nnarcotics addicts. The concept,\nsimilar to the currently airing\n“Night Call” program, would en¬\nable listeners in 50 markets to call\na central number in New York to\ntalk to one or more experts on\naddiction, seeking advice and coun¬\nsel regarding treatment.\nOccasional special events pro¬\ngramming would be aired in addi¬\ntion to, or possibly in place of, the\nregular nightly series.\nSummerfield describes the pro¬\nposed educational network as not\nreally a “renaissance of radio—\ncall it an urban renewal.”\nSandler, who originally was\nSlated to be a part of the public\nradio web, has taken a position\nwith a national book project. He\nwill be succeeded August 1 as\nexec director of NER by Robert\nMott, chairman of the department\nof communications and head of\nradio station KWSC at Washing¬\nton State U., Pulltmian. 1"
