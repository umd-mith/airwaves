For instance, there are two nom¬\ninees within the first twenty names listed, both coming from\nOregon. The question on my mind is whether this is what we\nreally want to do. Perhaps it might be better to go to the\nnext name on the list and have representation from another\nschool.\nI am not saying that this should be done, but the giUb-Committee\nshould discuss the matter and then act accordingly. Your\n, chairman will consider minor practical changes as being final.\nA very fine recommendation for Dr. Charles 0. Neidt was filed\n® ■ V- 1^. by Jack McBride. Due to a delay in mails, although the appli-\n'W- , cation was submitted on time, the credentials were never for-\n^ Warded to the members of this committee. Part of this was\n[ ' ■ ■ due to my oversight in the rush of getting this Job done. Will\n^ the Sub-Committee please decide if this nominee should be in¬\ncluded within the first twenty names. Perhaps the matter\ni, , m^^ht be briefly discussed with McBride in order to obtain a\n.Hooper briefing.\nAll of this may sound a little unfair to some members. How¬\never, we may expect the Sub-Committee to do a good Job of\nevaluating the matter and doing what is best for the entire\nAssociation.\nAlthough no meeting had been planned for St. Louis, I know\nGale will call together all members who are able to attend.\nIt is with considerable regret I will not be able to Join you\nat this times\nRDC:as\nEnclosure"
