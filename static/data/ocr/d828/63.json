Cheydleur\nFlorida State University\nTallahassee, Florida\nHello, Ray]\nDoing a little spade work on the bacK: shelf, I have just\ndug up your letter of September 11 about the Research Sminar\nwhich was to be held in December* Is that still on the schedule?\nFrankly, I haven*t done a doggone thing about lining up a\nparticipant from Wisconsin. As I explained easier, we had a new\nman who joined the journalism staff in September, and it was our\nexpectation that he would be assigned to the field of television\nresearch, but that hasn*t happened yet. Bruce Westl^Sr continues to\nsupervise a couple TV studies along with other activities in\njournalism, and I*m not sure he would be interested or able to\nparticipate even if invited or urged to do so.\nIn order to avoid feeling corraletely ignorant of what's going\non, 1*11 appreciate it if you'll bring me up to date. Is there to\nbe a seminar? Has it been postponed? Or what? Westly may even\nhave been negotiating with you separately but I've been too\nembarrassed to mention the matter without knowing more about it\nmyself. So, help a guy out, will you, please?\nCordially,\nH. B, McCarty\nDirector"
