  "text": "opportunity for future extension, whilst the architects have made\nprovision for such an eventuality.\nThe site itself is situated among the wooded surroundings of Hil-\nversum, and has been left partly untouched and partly transformed\ninto a landscape of lawns and flowerbeds. It is bordered on the\nside facing the road by a long, low structure whose upper surface\nbears a mosaic tablet, composed of natural stone slabs from the\nnumerous countries with which Radio Nederland maintains\nfriendly relations, either through its direct transmissions or its\nTranscription Department. The garden at the front contains a\nlarge rectangular lake. This is the cooling-lake for the air-con¬\nditioning of the studios. Its 660.000 imperial gallons of water fill\na technical need, and at the same time enhance the landscape\ngarden, the more so by reason of the row of fountains — a gift\nfrom the shipping companies to whose ships Radio Nederland\nhas broadcast so many greetings over the years.\nIn this setting, and in this building with its play of straight and\nslender design, with its materials of stone, concrete, glass, steel\nand timber, and its colour-schemes of grey, blue, brown and black,\nrelieved here and there by a splash of orange, Radio Nederland\nworks for the future. The new surroundings, so badly needed\nand so long abided, together with the new transmitters, form an\nattractive and inspiring place of work, adding colour and flourish\nto the job.\n“This is Radio Nederland .. .” we wrote at the beginning of this\nbooklet, quoting the words which open our English-language\ntransmissions. We hope that, when you hear these words on the\nair again, they will mean something more to you than they have\ndone in the past. For to us they mean our life-work, and you,\nthe listener, are very much a part of that.\n39"
