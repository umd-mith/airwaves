Governor LeRoy\nCollins, who is President of the National Association of Broadcasters (our\ncommercial counterpart) tells me that he has been using the same story on\nhis banquet circuit and that it is everywhere appreciated among the broad¬\ncasting fraternity. So you can see how far your influence has extended.\nI remember my visit to The Netherlands with the greatest of pleasure\nand frequently recall the pleasant hours spent with you and your associates\nPlease give my regards to all of them, especially Mr. Tijmstra.\nWith warm personal regards,\nCordially,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGHickn\nPjS. On checking back to your letter of December 5,1 see that you\npropose to distribute the leaflet. Unless I hear otherwise, I will\nassume that you will do so."
