  "text": "Mr. B. Underwood, Urbans, U.S.A.\n1\nTo give you an example of a program, which\ncould have been broadcasted on Friday .August 2 s\na. Profile of Holland*s prime minister\nDr. van Marijnen. .Announcer gives the\ninformation on the difficulties proceeding\nthe composition of a new government.\nb* The life of Spanish mineworkers during the\n.Asturian mine strike. Announcer tells why\nthe strikes were not suppressed by the\nFranco government, although it has the\npower to do so*\nc. The growing popularity of chicken meat,\nwhich -ten years ago - was considered\nluxury, and the change in chicken breeding\nin Europe, which caused this popularity.\nAnnouncer tells of Mr# Harter*s attempts\nto keep the Cornea Market open for American\nchickens and of the attempts of the European\nchicken breeders to keep the Americans out.\nYou see it all boils down to the idea that the\nfactual reports on the news are given by the announcer and\nthat the correspondent elaborates on a particular aspect.\nI am very anxious to hear your opinion on this idea.\nI have sent a copy of this letter to Bill\nHarley and I have asked him too giving his comment on my\nsuggestions. That I write you so late is because there\nhas been some delay between the cabletests and the reactions.\nWBVB did send the tapes by airmail but its accompanying\nletter by sea.\nIt is therefore that I imagine some speed might\nbe necessary, because probably some stations change their\nprogramschedule on September or October 1.\nWhat Badio Nederland is concerned, we can start\nthe cable transmission any day."
