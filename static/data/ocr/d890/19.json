Harley\nPresident National Association\nof Educational Broadcasters\nDuPont Circle Office Building\n1346, Connecticut Avenue N.W.\nW a -s h i n g t on 6, D.C.\nU.S.A.\nDear Bill,\nAlthough you did not hear from me for some time that\ndoes not mean that our interest in the relay-program is\ndiminishing. There is a regular contact with the people in\nAnn Arbor, especially Mr. Burrows and things are coming off\nbeautifully. No need to bother you, as far as that aspect is\nconcerned.\nThe reason I write you (apart from expressing the\nhope that all is well with you) is that we got some letters\nfrom U.S. radio stations asking whether there is a possibilitjr\nto monitor our transmissions and use material in their broad¬\ncasts. As they seem to be most interested in our news programs,\nwe thought it only fair to ask your opinion (an interest which\nseems to us not wholly unconnected to our relay-programs, though\nthey do not mention them directly).\nThe stations concerned are WZIP - Radio, 458 Wood\nAvenue, Cincinati 20, Ohio (the letter is signed by Robert Y.\nMerrymann, News and Special Events) and WYBR-FM in Ithaca, N.Y.\n(this letter is signed by Mrs. or Miss Althea May, Ass. News\nDirector). WYBR-FM seems to be the station of Cornell University.\nIf these stations are connected with NAEB there is\nof course no difficulty at all. If not, we would like you to\nstate your honest opinion on what could be our attitude towards\nstations not affiliated to NAEB.\nIn principle we would gladly help any station asking\nfor facilities. On the other hand we would like the advice of\nour friends Hof the first hour*.\nPlease let me know what you think about it.\nCordially,\nRADIO NEDERLAND JWERELDOMROEP\nLs Juliil WTlcda ✓\nHead Central Programme Service\nMAR 1 ic\nam\n7!?{0/10(llfi2( 2(2"
