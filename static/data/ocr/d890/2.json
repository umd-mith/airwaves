AOR. muno,vox-h,LvErsum 1346 Connecticut Avenue\nJP/EB Washington 6, D.C.\nU.S.A.\nBear Bill,\nIt was so nice to have you here in Holland.\nMy wife and I do hope you and your family survived the\n\"poffertjes\" and that your European trip was a pleasant\nexperience to all of you.\nAs you will have heard, we made two test\ntransmissions of European Review by cable. In the opinion\nof WRVR the technical quality is \"quite acceptable\" for\nrebroadcasting. Consequently WRVR likes to use the program\nand is willing to send a copy (or the mastertape) to\nBob Underwood for multiplication.\nWith regard to objections carrying a program\ntwice a week under the same title and with identical\ncontents, I made some suggestions in a letter to Bob.\nEnclosed you will find a copy of this letter. Please let\nyour thoughts go over my ideas.\nConcerning the extra costs as a result of\ntransmitting European Review by cable, we have calculated\nthat this involves the sum of 14000 per year. I know that\nthe budgetary position of the educational stations — in\nparticular radio stations - is not too rosy. So I leave\nit \"a votre discretion\" what sum NAEB can afford to\ncontribute.\nRECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nAUG 19 1963\nAM P*\n7)8|d|ip|ll|12| 1,2|8|4|5|6"
