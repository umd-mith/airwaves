As soon as\nour new station in Grand Rapids goes on the air in November, that\nfigure can be doubled. From WHA in Wisconsin, an entire network of\nstations throughout that state is served, covering presumably almost\nthe entire oopulation of Wisconsin* Bill Harley can perhaps give you\nsome specific figures on this. WGBH in Boston not only covers a good\nportion of New England but through affiliated stations along the 'East\nCoast can reach enormous numbers of people. And so on and so forth*\nThere is no question that several million listeners are involved, but\nJust how many million I would hesitate to say.\nI hope this will be of some help to you. Again, best wishes.\nCcr dlally.\nE.G* Burrows\nManager, WUOM"
