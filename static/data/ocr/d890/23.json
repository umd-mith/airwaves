A.\nDear Mr# Burrows,\nThis is to inform you that I shall be leaving\nthe Netherlands in the second half of February for a two\nmonth visit to the United States. Needless to say, I am\nlooking forward to come back to the United States, where\nI have so many good friends and where I hope to make new\nfriends among the N.A.E.B. associates#\nIn order to ensure that my trip will be as\neffective as possible - to visit all N.A.E.B. stations\nis out of the question, since this would cost me\napproximately four months - I would like to suggest the\nfollowing procedure.\n.enclosed in this letter is a draft question¬\nnaire, which I want to submit to the N.A.E.B. stations.\nTheir answers will serve as a good basis for drafting\nmy itinerary. Moreover the data will be of great help\nwhen 1 have to prepare my contribution for Hadio Neder¬\nland’s Annual Beport 1962.\nTwo practical ways of submitting the question¬\nnaire come to minds either I could mail direct to the\nN.A.E.B. stations, or send you the necessary number of\ncopies for distribution.\nSince I am leaving at a comparatively short\nnotice, I assume, that if no reply from you has arrived\nbefore December 15th, you agree to it, that I send the\nquestionnaires directly to the N.A.iS.B. stations.\nI sincerely hope that you can agree to this\nprocedure.\nLooking forward to your reply, I remain\nSincerely yours,\nHADIO NEDERLAND WSRELDOMHOEP\nA.J.
