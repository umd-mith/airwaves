On\nFriday we will transmit the program whioh was original¬\nly titled \"life in the Old World8 but has been rebapt¬\nized \"Transatlantic -rofile\". The change in title was\nmade after discussions with M Burrows, during his\nstay in The Netherlands. Sd feared that the title\n\"life in the Old World\" could lead to the misunder¬\nstanding that the program deals with historical items,\ne thought he had a good point there and we gladly\naccepted his suggestion* 8Transatlantic Profile\". We\nwill broadcast both programs to you at 9.1$ p.m. GMT.\nsincerely yours,\nRADIO MBBSHUSS WSSR811)Gfi®Q8J?\nAnd rise i. Pot\nHead Relay Service\no.o. Br» Harley\nMr. Underwood\nMr, Burro**"
