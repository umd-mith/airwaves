We discussed some points relevant\nto the European He view project.\nIn order to organize the *• stand-by” programs\n(a matter more intricate than our originally thought) we\nwould like to know what programs could not be used by your\norganization, owing to bad reception, etc. There might be\na possibility then, to use this material, or part of it, for\nHstand-by” programs* Would it be possible for you to let us\nknow, regularly, the dates you were able to pick up our\nprograms directly? If this is of any help to you we can provide\nyou with printed forms.\nTwo w stand-by” programs will reach you in the\ncourse of next week, two more somewhat later. These programs\nwill have an alfabetical indication (first program: A, second\nprogram B etc.) The only thing you have to do is to let us\nknows MBad reception, used stand-by program AM, etc.\nYou will understand that this knowledge is\nnecessary in order to see whether stand-by programs are dated,\nhow many new programs you need, etc.\nIf there is anything elsd you want to know\n(or to have) please let me know.\nCordially,\nRADIO NEDERLAND WERELDOMROEP\nJ.W.
