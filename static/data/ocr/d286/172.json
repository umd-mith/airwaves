John did\ngive it to me and I had every intention of calling\nyou. Unfortunately, all kinds of problems cropped up\nand I never had the chance to use the number. Inci¬\ndentally, I did not know that you were here on vaca¬\ntion. I assumed it was a business-type trip. Had I\nknown, I would not have suggested our getting together.\nI'm working on a progress report to be sent to\nthe Utilization Committee. As soon as I have it in\nrough form I will send it to you. It is basically the\nsame as the letter to Spalding but in a much greater\ndetail.\nSorry to not have seen you.\nSincerely, ^\nClair R. Tettemer\n/ Director of School\nPrograms & Research\nCRT/gvc"
