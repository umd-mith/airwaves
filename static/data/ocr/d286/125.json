McNaughten, Page 2, May 14. 1959\nSuch a *8shot in the arm” lor radio would also seem appropriate and states-\nmanlike at a time when most foundation funds are flowing only into television\nalthough ! believe all signs point to the need for intensified, increased inte¬\ngration of all these electronic media if education is to be given the help it\nneeds.\nIt is for these reasons that we felt a preliminary approach to you might be\nin order. Might you sometime soon be in the Chicago area, where we might\nmeet with you to discuss this further? We wish to proceed properly, and are\ncontacting you now in this preliminary way only on a purely exploratory basis\nin the hope that further discussion might be possible •\nI*d bo grateful for your reaction and suggestions. And I do hope we may have\na chance to discuss this sometime soon.\nSincerely,\nExecutive Director\nhjssrs\nB1CC; NAEB Board\nFinance Committee\nLeonard H. Marks\nM. S. Novik"
