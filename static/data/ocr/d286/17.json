  "text": "9\ncontinuation of these radio program grants • The selection and distribution\nof these programs are still handled by the NAEB, but all contractual arrange¬\nments with grant recipients are handled by the Center and grantee reports are\nmade directly to them.\nOn the basis of latest reports and national recognitions achieved by\nthese programs, the return received on these relatively small sums would\nappear to have justified them® It also has made possible several joint radio-\nTV efforts and uses. Since the NAEB believes in the eventual integrated uses\nof all electronic media for education, it is particularly interested in keeping\nboth radio and television in a position to share the electronic educational\nload, which we believe the future holds in store, and which will require all\nthe facilities and trained uses in both media which our nation can provide •"
