Since these would be local or\nregional, it is our belief that the costs of travel would not be the\ninhibiting factor which they would constitute for national meetings.\nThe NAEB’s contributions would be limited to reimbursing cooperating\ninstitutions for actual expenses, reports and demonstration materials\nexpenses, and paying for necessary consultants. Estimate: $1,500\nper workshop the first year, $1,000 the second year and $500 the third\nyear for a total of $6,000 the first year, $4,000 the second year and\n$2,000 the third year. All income would be used to reduce the actual\ngrant expenses used for this purpose. A gradual effort, as needed,\nwould be made to make these increasingly self-supporting, through the\nlife of the project.\nThese workshops and Seminars would also be principally, but not ex¬\nclusively, for teachers and teacher-trainers. Some of the other empha¬\nses, as now visualised, would be in the fields of graphics and visual\naids; script planning and writing; production; series planning; evalua¬\ntion; and new testing procedures to meet the needs of the new media.\nCross-pollenization with communications, techniques, content and\nteacher-training procedures would be emphasized.\nC. Consultants and other expenses;\nBesides the above workshops, qualified consultants would be provided each of\nthe cooperating institutions and/or the teachers of such courses as will be\ndeveloped under this project; these services would be provided particularly"
