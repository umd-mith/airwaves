If additional channels are applied the equipment becomes more\ncomplex and expensive. We have applied as many as three additional channels\nsuccessfully. The range of the multiplex channel is much less than that\nof the main channel and becomes still less as additional multiplex chan¬\nnels are added.\nIf you would care to give ms further information as to your specific appli¬\ncation of lmiltiplcxing, I would be glad to comment further.\nVery truly yours,\nCROSBY LABORATCmiES, INC.\n/s/ Murray G.
