Crosby, President\nand Research Director\nCrosby Labs, Incorporated\nBax 233, Robbins Lane\nHicksville, L.I., New York\nv\nDear Mr. Crosby:\nI was recently discussing the development of FM multiplexing\nwith Mr. Coalton of the RCA Engineering Products Division, who told\nme you had done much of the development work. He also said that you\nhad published an article in the July-August 19^3 issue of Communi¬\ncation Engineering, covering this development! however the University\nof Illinois does not have this publication on file in its library.\nIf there are reprints of this article available, I would appre¬\nciate knowing where I might obtain one. I am investigating the pos¬\nsibility of the use of FM multiplexing in a network of educational\nFM stations.\nAny information you may be able to furnish will be appreciated.\nYours very truly,\nCSBscp\nCecil S. Bidlack\nTelevision Engineer"
