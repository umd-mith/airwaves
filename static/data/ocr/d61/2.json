J|?|3*,4|5|9\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr. Bidlack:\nIn accordance with the request of your letter 12 No¬\nvember 1954, I am enclosing herewith a copy of the article I wrote\nregarding the use of FM multiplex for binaural transmission.\nI gather that your usage of multiplex would not use\nthe system for binaural transmission, but might apply two separate\nprograms. Accordingly, perhaps I can give you a brief review of\nthe status of such operation at this time.\nAt the present time, we are a bit unhappy with the\nstatus of the development of multiplex equipment. In the past,\nmany laboratory demonstrations have been made which gave satis¬\nfactory operation. However, when we tried to reduce the equipment\nto a practical stage many problems appeared. When separate pro¬\ngrams are applied, as distinguished from binaural transmission,\nthe degree of cross-modulation between channels must be reduced\nto values far in excess of that necessary for binaural transmission.\nAt present we are not satisfied with the levels of cross-modulation\nthat we obtained on our existing equipment and we have invested so\nmuch in the development program so far that we have been forced\nto slow down the amount of effort we put into the project. We have\ntried to enlist the interest of other companies, who might be willing\nto finance the additional development work required, but so far have\nhad no success. Most people look upon FM as a money-losing pro¬\nposition no matter how you look at it.\nThe most economical multiplexing system would\n• R A D I O - E L E C T R O N I C RESEARCH • DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING"
