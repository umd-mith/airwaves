If additional channels are applied\nthe equipment becomes more complex and expensive. We have\napplied as many as three additional channels successfully. The range\nof the multiplex channel is much less than that of the main channel\nand becomes still less as additional multiplex channels are added.\nIf you would care to give me further information as\nto your specific application of multiplexing, I would be glad to com¬\nment further.\nVery truly yours,\nCROSBY LABORATORIES, INC.\nMGC/he\nEnc.
