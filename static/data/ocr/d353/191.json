The\nSocialists and Communists, and their dupes, talk\nagainst the profit motive; and yet they are them¬\nselves utilizing the motive in everything they do.\nTheir classic fallacies about business profits are\nexposed. With three-dimensional tools. Dr. Ganus\nbreaks down the national income to determine\nwhere it goes; analyzes corporation profits in re¬\nlationship to sales; and takes an actual sales dollar\nout of the annual statement of a well-known meat\npacking company and divides it up to show how\nmany pennies went for raw materials, for wages,\nsalaries and employee benefits; for shipping costs\nand supplies; for taxes and plant maintenance; and\nhow many were left to pay dividends and to plow\nback into the business. Less than one penny of net\nprofit out of each sales dollar!\nAbove: Professor Ganus nips corpora¬\ntion profits from the national income\nand traces it to its destination and\nfunction. Left: the goose that laid\nthe golden eggs, and its unfortunate\nexperience, is a lesson applicable\ntoday; Ibelowl the class gets to\nguess the profit percentage on sales."
