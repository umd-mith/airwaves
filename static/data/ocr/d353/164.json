Underwood, jr. /\nNetwork Manager,\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters,\nUrbana, Illinois.\nBear Mr,Underwood,\nHaving already had the pleasure of corespondence with\nyou, as your letter of June 4th, 1957 shows, I take the liberty at\nthis time of writing to you again .\nAt this time,I have a little problem in regard to the\nfuture of my program ’’LIVING WITH LANGUAGES ” and hope that you\nwould be good enough to give me some advice, and if possible, other\nassistance.I am enclosing my brochure of the 1957-58 sereis that had\nbeen partially sponcered for that year by the Ella Lyman Trust of\nBoston, and had appeared on the F.M , Emerson College in Boston.\nAs my corespondence( enclosed) with the Broadcasting\nDepartment of Emerson College shows, I ran into a rather unfortunate\nsituation there. The future of ’’LIVING WITH LANGUAGES” is unditermined\nand my efforts and time of the past 9 months unaccounted for.\non the first, or the very latest, second week of August,\nI am flying to Germany ( Munich) to continue my studies in the feild\nof languages and comparative linguistics at the University of Munich.\nThis trip has been planned as far back as March of last year. Before\nI leave, I would like to sell all rights to my Radio program \"LIVING\nwith LANGUAGES”, as well as those tapes that are now in my posession.-\nfor a very nominal sum. In thetvent that this is not possible, I shall\nthen publish my scripts abroad. t\nI would greatly appreciate NAEB^desision on this matter\nbefore my leaving. If I hear from you not later then August St 7Th, I\ncan then consumate ikE my plans accordingly. -\nearliest convenience,\nHoping to hear fron you at your\nSincerely yours,\nHelenp-Brokloff Renick.\nJi/:"
