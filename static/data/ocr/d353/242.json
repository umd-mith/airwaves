I have 5|ssumed\nthat the problem is in the masters because we have had\nthe same problem with programs on transcription from\nPrance. Have you noticed this?\nOnce again I have heard that a Mr. Hill was\nin town recently. He was here for a TV seminar of some\nsort. I didn’t see* him, but I have heard reports.\nIs there really such a person?\nAll the best to you and yours. And thanks for\nthe splendid service. NAEB tapes have become as reliable\nas the noon whistle.\nSincerely\nCliff Eblen\nRadio Hall\nMadison 6, Wisconsin"
