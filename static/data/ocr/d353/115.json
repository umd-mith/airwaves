It is the mission of this\noffice to make available to the public any and all information about Army\nactivities which might affect the general public. Many of these activities;\nhowever, are quite broad in nature and do not necessarily fall into the\n“spot” news category. We have found that one of the best means of ful¬\nfilling our mission of keeping the public informed about such activities\nis thru the distribution of such radio programs as “Queen of Battle.”\nABOUT THE SHOW-some of the technical data\n“Queen of Battle” is produced weekly and distributed each Tuesday by\nfirst-class mail to individual subscribers. Series units of 13 shows each\nare sent to distributing agents quarterly for distribution within their area\nnetworks.\nIn addition to the regular weekly programming, special shows are sent\nto each subscribing station for use during Christmas and Easter broad¬\ncasting periods. These shows are of a special nature and are designed to\nfit in with the seasonal programming for which they are produced.\n“Queen of Battle” is recorded chiefly on Ampex “600” tape recorders.\nOnly the highest quality microphones and field recording equipment is used\nin order to produce shows of top calibre. Recordings are made at 7 1/2\ninches per second. Voice closing on all shows is at 14:30 or less with\nmusic extending 10 seconds.\nQuestions, suggestions and criticisms are welcome and appreciated.\nMail should be addressed to your distributing agent, or to Mr. William\nW. Bryant; Chief, Radio-TV Branch; Information Section; Fort Benning, Ga."
