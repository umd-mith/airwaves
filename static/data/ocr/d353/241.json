Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nSEP 1 7 1958\n_ ^ .19.1 I \\\nDear Bob,\nSorry to have taken so long to reply to\nyour inquiry about Dahlgren* Enclosed is all the\ninformation I have about the Swedish Radio and Teie-\nvislon program service*\nAs to Dahlgren himself, he is the American\nrepresentative for this outfit* He is on the level,\nbut I don’t think he understands the programming of\neducationat stations* The music ho has offered us so\nfar is not very interesting* We have used none of it*\nAnd a look a his catalogue indicates that most of the\nmusic which would interest us is already available\non records*\nThe kind of thing he has sent us is \"musicale”\ntype stuff* Glossy arrangements of standard tunes,\nsome Swedish smorgasbord and so forth* It seems to\nme that your Swedish musical offerings are far superior\nto anything he might bo able to offer you*\nHowever, I would look a little further into\nhis offer. He might be able to supply a limited murnbor\nof programs for some dry spell in the future* The company\nhe represents seems to be on the make and might be useful\nto NAEB in some way* As far as WHA is concerned, we are\nnot interested in music from the network* (except in rare\ncases)\nWhich brings mo to another topic* I suggested\nat one point that wo might offer i|.0 hour long lectures\non Indians which had been popular here. I have abandoned\nthe idea for the present because we are developing a new\nseries on a more modest basis. I’ll let you know what\nhappens* If they are good enough we’ll offer them*\nThe fourth quarter offering is particularly\njuicy this time* We have scheduled most of it and are\nwaiting expectantly for the programs to start*"
