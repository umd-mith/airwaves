Reynolds\nEducational Relations Services Dept.\nGeneral Electric Company\nBuilding 2, Room 243\nSchenectady 5, New York\nDear Mr. Reynolds:\nDuring the first two weeks in January, I received an\norder blank from a Mr. Carl Lindgren, requesting information\nabout our Fact Sheets, etc. On January 14, I wrote Mr.\nLindgren explaining the details regarding our new £act Sheets\nexplaining however, that because the purchase order for a\nrenewal was sent to us before the end of 1957 (even though\nwe didn't receive it until the first week in January), you\ncould renew your Fact Sheet subscription at the old price of\n$2.50.\nI would like to know therefore, whether you still wish\nto discontinue your subscription or whether you now would\nlike to continue receiving the Fact Sheets at the usual $2.50\nprice, per my original letter of January 14. May I hear from\nyou or Mr. Lindgren regarding this matter.\nSincerely,\n(Mrs.) Judith B. Gans\nSecretary\nEnclosure (photo of 1/14 letter)"
