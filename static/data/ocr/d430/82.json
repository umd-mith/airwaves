  "text": "1. Transfer of Qualified Applicants.\nApplicants not accommodated in the country of their first\nchoice are considered for alternate countries. These trans¬\nfers are completed, however, only after consultation with the\napplicant. Members of the advisory screening committees\nshould feel free to recommend such transfers.\n2. Recruited Applicants.\nApplications for existing vacancies are invited from persons\nwho have been suggested to the staff of the Conference Board\nCommittee, or who have previously indicated an interest in\nthe program by filing data sheets. Suggestions of scholars\nwho might be approached by the Conference Board Committee\nare especially welcomed from advisory committee members\nbecause of their familiarity with possible candidates.\nApplications are accepted on a recruitment or invitational basis as\nlong as there are unfilled awards in the program, and it is generally\nnecessary to ask the screening committees to review them by mail.\nSMITH-MUNDT AWARDS\nApplication papers for awards under the Smith-Mundt Act are also\nreviewed by mail by all advisory screening committees, but since these\ngrants are not filled from the scheduled competitions, the rating forms\nare somewhat different.
