  "text": "f\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\nWASHINGTON\nFebruary 3, 1962\nDear Mr. Harley:\nThe President asked me to acknowledge your letter of\nJanuary 26. You may be assured that his response at\nhis press conference did not indicate a lack of interest\nin the educational television bill before Congress. As\nyou know, there is a difference between the Senate and\nHouse versions. Moreover, the bill has not yet been\nreported to the House Floor from the House Rules Com¬\nmittee. It was the analysis of differences between the\nHouse and Senate bills and the doubt about the final\naction to be taken by the Congress that the President\nhad in mind when he responded to the question.\nThe Administration has indicated, in testimony by\nSecretary Ribicoff and by Chairman Minow, that it\nwholeheartedly supports the principles implicit in the\nlegislation. It has long been the President’s view that\neducational excellence can be better attained by the use\nof educational television channels.\nSincerely yours.\nMyer Feldman\nDeputy Special Counsel\nto the President\nMr. William G. Harley\nPresident\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, NW.\nWashington 6, D. C."
