Johnson\nExecutive Director\nERMA-TV» Channel 6\n1261 Glenarm Place\nDenver 4, Colorado\nDear Howard:\nThe attached news clip is, without doubt, no news to\nyou. This action of the Colorado Brow dossiers Association\nwhich has been widely reported comes at a crucial time. X\nas particularly concerned that CBA \"is urging Colorado’s\ncongressional delegation to oppose any legislation along\nthese lines.\"\nThis is sometlees all it takes to bring a Representative\nto a Rules Committee hearing on IT? with a long negative\nspeech, it has happened before when Congressman Avery of\nKansas opposed granting a rule in the 86th Congress. There\nhas been a good bit of good will steam built up for IT?\nlegislation in this Congress and it would be unfortunate if\nsuch of it was lost because of the views of one State’s\nbroadcasters’ association.\nI hope efforts are being sade to neutralise the\nposition of the CBA as it say have been expressed to the\nfollowing:\nSenator Gordon Llewellyn Allott (R.)\nSenator John Albert Carroll <D.)\nRepresentst*ve Byron Giles Rogers (D.), First District•-\nCity and County of Denver.\nRepresentative Peter H.
