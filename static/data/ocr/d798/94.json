Hull, Executive Director 2470 North Star Road\nColumbus 21, Ohio\nJanuary 5, 1962\nMiss Betty MeIIvane\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n13^6 Connecticut Ave., N.W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Betty:\nFinally back at the office on January 3rd (late arrival due\nto weather problems at London airport), with your special delivery letter\nin re Walter Stone1^ request arriving late that afternoon.\nI did some investigation and then called Stone directly,\nsince l had some other matters to discuss with him.\nMy advice: that the NAEB would take no position on this\nbill unless forced to by Oren Harris. The bill, I felt, was responsive\nto the concerns which followed the quiz hearings and more timely when\nproposed than presently. The bill is unpopular with the FCC who regards\nthis as its area of administrative concern.\nNew legislation, I suggested to Stone, which would create\na national governmental board of review with a broader purview in tele«*»\ncommunications might have merit, but the Ashley bill, I felt, would\nrequire almost complete rewriting to be acceptable politically or other¬\nwise.\nI told Stone I did not share the view of NETRC or JCET that\na citizen*s commission would fill this need—that such efforts had been\ntried repeatedly by a number of groups or agencies including the Fund\nfor Adult Education (early in its history—the only outcome, incidentally,\nwas OMNIBUS). However, a presidential commission which would be a real\nor quasi agency of government is quite a different thing.\nSincerely,\nRichard B. Hull, Director\n._.v.- r r } Telecommunications Center\nS&VeadquarTers\nj(\\N8- 1962 ^\nl\nRBH/anh\ncc: Harold Hill\nJim Miles\nLoren Stone\nTeaching Aids Laboratory • Office of Seminars and Workshops • Ohio School of the Air • Video Recording • WOSU-WOSU-FM—WOSU-TV • Closed Circuit TV"
