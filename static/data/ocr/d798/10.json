C.\nDear Bill:\nIt was good to see you again and to work with you in Philadelphia and New\nYork City. If there is anything I can do to further the project, I am at your\ncommand.\nIt came to my attention from Ken Wright that Ed Wegener, as consultant to\nthe Chattanooga and Nashville ETV situations, was using a copy of the HEW\nregulations on the ETV matching legislation. He obtained this copy from\nDave Stewart. This provoked Ken Wright because discussion was going on\nin Tennessee about the regulations which were unfamiliar to him. These,\nI am sure, were not intended to have been released, or why shouldn't we all\nhave had them? Can you check this with the HEW and determine the facts?\nI wish to have my name kept out of it, if possible.\n<C C2/tf=> £-?€ n<z I P f^JiovZ/^S 15 TO\nThe following are the requested recommendations for restructuring the NAEB\nand are based upon the premise that a NAEB grass roots organization located\nin every state will be wisely building for the future and on the most democratic\nbasis:\nSTATE CHAPTERS\ntn every state possible, there should be a chapter of the NAEB.\na.
