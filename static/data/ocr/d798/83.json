One part of the proposed television development seminar -- but one\nreceiving special emphasis from the stations -- would deal with act¬\nivation of new stations and the special need for training personnel\nto staff the new stations.\n5. The stations urged the NAEB staff to give every possible assistance\nto the FCC Broadcast Bureau in finding a properly qualified person to\nfill the position being created as head of the Education Division. It\nwas suggested that a careful review of the NAEB membership be made by\na committee as the first step in this search.\n6. The stations requested, and the Television Board approves a request\nthat NAEB institute an application to the FCC for a rule-making pro¬\ncedure to amend the rules relating to Translator operation to permit\noriginal programming by non-commercial educational licensees on these\nassignments.\n7. The stations hope that the up-coming study of NAEB membership\nqualifications will include information on the availability of people\nwithin television stations who are available for emergency loan to\nstations needing help in various phases of their operation.\nLoren B -Stone, Chairman\nNAEB Television Board\ncc: TV Board members"
