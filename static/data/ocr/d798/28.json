Harley\nPresident, NAEB\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Bill;\nI HAVE AT HAND JOHNNY ScHWARZWALDER1S\nLATEST DIATRIBE. IrM AFRAID l AM NO MORE\nIMPRESSED BY IT THAN I WAS BY PREVIOUS ONES.\nI THINK THE ACTION TAKEN AT THE MEETING IN\nWashington were in line and trust we are\nPROCEEDING ALONG THOSE LINES.\nI AM CURRENTLY READING \"THE RISE AND FALL\nof the Third Reich\". Compared to the\nMACHINATIONS OF THE GERMAN POLITICIANS AT\nTHE TIME THEY CAME TO POWER, THE CURRENT\nones with NAEB, NETRC, and various splinter\nGROUPS SEEM MIGHTY MINUTE. HOWEVER, THERE\nIS ONE LESSON TO BE LEARNED, AND THAT IS THAT\nWE MUST REMAIN TRUE TO OUR BELIEFS IN THE\nDEMOCRATIC PROCESSES AND CONTINUE TO ALLOW\nPEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR OWN OPINION, BUT NOT\nBE SWAYED BY THREATS OF WITHDRAWAL OR\nOBVIOUS EVIDENCES OF BAD FAITH. CERTAINLY WE\nSHOULD NOT EXCHANGE ONE CURRENT DICTATOR FOR\nONE POTENTIAL DICTATOR. I HAVE FAITH THAT\nTHE WAY WILL BE FOUND TO SETTLE OUR\nDIFFERENCES AND MOVE AHEAD RAPIDLY VIA THE\nDEMOCRATIC PROCESS.\nSincerely,\n/\nJames S. Miles\nDirector Radio-TV\nJSM/bs"
