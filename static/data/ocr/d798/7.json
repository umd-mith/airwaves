C.\nDear Bill:\nEven after ten days have elapsed since the NAEB Board\nmeeting, I am no mere satisfied or pleased with the\naction the Board took on the matter of television\nproduction than I was at the time*\nIt seems to me that the Board made it abundantly clear\nthat they don’t want the television stations in the\nassociation, or certainly not with the stations them¬\nselves having any real voice in what the association\ndoes to or for them. It should have been fully clear\nto Hull, Miles, etc. that the Stations were and are\ngreatly opposed to NAEB being in television production.\nI would like you to send me a copy of just what action\nthe Board took — I understand they took some sort of\naction while I was out of the meeting, and I would like\nto be accurate in what I report to the stations, for I\nhave a responsibility to report to the stations just what\nthe NAEB Board did on the matter, and I don’t wish to be\ninaccurate in my reporting.\nI am sure that our station will not continue its member¬\nship in NAEB, although I will continue as an individual\nmember. It appears clear to me that the stations are\ngoing to have to create some mechanism for themselves\nthat will not be controlled by non-station-managers. I\nthink we will reserve our dues and energies for something\nthat will be responsive to our own needs -- which are great.\nLoren B.
