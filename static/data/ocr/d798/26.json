May I state again that, as here¬\ntofore, I am heartily in sympathy with your ambitions and hopes for\na strong and independent NAEB organization. Furthermore, I am\nequally as concerned over our state of solvency. Because of\nthese common, mutual attitudes on our part, I feel that we are\nmore responsible and have greater obligations to NAEB than some\nwho have not sensed the serious conditions I mention. I am con¬\nvinced that we can slog through these times if we are sufficiently\ndedicated, determined and patient. I accepted the chairmanship\nof the NAEB TV Board with your blessing and have tried conscien¬\ntiously to dispatch my responsibility in that office. I must\nhave your support if we are to make haste ever so slowly. In this\nconnection I mailed to you yesterday a proposal for structural\nchange that in my opinion will broaden the base of NAEB and more\neffectively democratize its operation. If you approve of this\nprojected plan, I will most certainly need your assistance in\nhaving it accepted and expedited.\nI hope that you believe that I am seriously endeavoring to streng¬\nthen our professional organization in every possible way I know.\nI am herein requesting personally and as a fellow broadcaster\nthat you assist me in what I know to be honest efforts toward\ngrowth and development of our great organization. Please let me\nhear from you at your earliest convenience.\nWith kindest personal regards, I am\nSincerely yours,\nRDH/1t\nRaymond D. Hurlbert\nGeneral Manager"
