Hull, Director\nRadio and TV Broadcasting\nOhio State University\n215 West 19th Avenue\nColumbus, Ohio\nDear Dick:\nIn respect to your letter of August 20 about the\nEducational Media Council, I suggest that we retain the\nstatus quo as regards NAEB representation. Let’s keep\nHull and Harley as the official representatives, with Hill\nas the backup man. With this arrangement. Hill can attend\nwhenever you or I are unable to be present. This will\nprovide for continuity and insure that at least two people\nare there for each meeting.\nSo far as the October session is concerned, we will\njust assume that you will not be able to make it and\nhave Harold attend in your place,\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nCC: Harold E.HU1\nWGHijah"
