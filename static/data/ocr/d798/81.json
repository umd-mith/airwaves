Hie University of Utah, which has been using translators\nunder special PCC authorisation, plans to file a petition for rulemaking\nas soon as their data are complete. At that time, the MSB will file a\nsupporting petition.\nAt the present time we feel that the chances of getting the grant from\nthe USOE for the personnel inventory are slim. However, should such a\ngrant be forthcoming, we will certainly try to winnow out the information\nyou suggest about the availability of certain people for emergency loan\nto stations needing assistance.\nCordially,\nHarold g. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nHSf/mlm\ncej Mr. Raymond Hurlbert"
