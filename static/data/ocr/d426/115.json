In order to ensure the widest possible distribution and sale\nof the proposed listener guides and pamphlets overseas, t?t.r\nwould propose to make arrangements with the Macmillan Company\nof New York for manufacturing and distribution. As exclusive\nholder of the rights to the project developed materials, ELS\nwould propose to grant these rights to the Macmillan Company\nto enable the Macmillan Company to secure copyright to the\nmaterials. It is mutually agreed and understood that the\nlistener guides and pamphlets to be distributed and sold\noverseas must be low-priced in the interest of the success\nof the U.S.I.A. radio programs. Further, it is agreed that\nthe actual sale price of the listener guides and pamphlets\nwill be established in consultation with the N.A.E.B.\n6. ELS proposes to complete the development of the required\nprospectus and the sixty-five fifteen-minute radio scripts\nwithin a period of four months following the effective\nbeginning date of the proposed contract with the N.A.E.B.\nIt is estimated that, following the completion of project\nmaterials, an additional period of sixty days will be required\nby the Macmillan Company for manufacturing and release of the\nprinted listener materials.\nWe have developed preliminary work plans and procedures for the develop¬\nment of the proposed materials and would be prepared to undertake the\nproject immediately upon award of contract.\nShould you require additional details or clarification of our proposal,\nI hope you will not hesitate to call me.\nSincerely,\nEdwin T. Cornelius, Jr.\nPresident\nETC/ja"
