Fellows\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W*\nWashington 36, D.C.\nCover Letter\nDear Jim:\nOn another project on which I worked, we developed the\nsystem of restricting each letter to one general subject,\nso as to promote efficiency in action and filing. I expect\nto follow the same procedure on this project, at least for\nthe time being, unless NAEB policy suggests otherwise.\nIn line with this, I am enclosing Marjerie*s and my\nclaims for reimbursement for our travel expenses on our\nrecent trip to Washington, and a letter concerning Marjerie*s\nemployment.\nI very much enjoyed meeting you on our visit, and I look\nforward to seeing you again on future trips. My wife and I\nhope that you will feel free to drop by and visit us any time\nyou may have occasion to be in New York.\nOur work is proceeding satisfactorily, I believe, and\nthis weekend I expect to forward to you drafts of the 13\nscripts and a progress report as stipulated in the agreement*\nMarjerie has received her check for her half-month*s\nsalary, and I received mine for my expenses on my visit to\nWashington in May* I might note that on the copy of the\ntravel voucher which was enclosed with the check, the date\nof my visit was given as June 23 instead of the correct\nMay 23.\nSincerely yours,\n0. Dean Gregory"
