A BRIEF PARAPHRASE\nThe poet says that the lives of the people In the houses are dull and\nunimaginative and are as undistinguished and colorless as the nightgowns\nthey wear. Yet the drunken sailor who has fallen asleep still wearing his\nboots has exciting dreams, and is somehow, because of his Imagination and\nindividuality, more in touch with life than the respectable citizens.\nII. THE GLOSSARY:\nbaboons (n. pi.)\nbeaded (adj.)\nceintures (n. pi.. Archaic)\ndisillusionment (n.s.)\nhaunted (adj.)\nhere and there (adv. phrase)\nnightgowns (n. pi.)\nperiwinkles (n. pi.)\nrings (n. pi)\nsocks (n. pi.)\nlarge apes\ndecorated with small pieces of glass\nor metal\nbelts\ndisappointment, disenchantment\ninhabited by ghosts and spirits\nin various places\nloose garments worn in bed\nshellfish similar to snails\ncircular designs\nshort stockings"
