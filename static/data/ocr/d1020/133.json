Schooley\nRe:\nCommittees/ Communications\n1„ Intro« I admit to fudging on November 179 but I’m trying\nto start things and catch up at the same time.\n2o Thanks for your responses to my committee inquiry. All but\none director responded,, although one responding was too late for\nconsideration. I thank you all* I trust you’ll accept, if not\napprove my appointments* Couldn’t please all. Couldn’t even please\nmyself in all cases. But I did receive many fine suggestions.\n3„ It is the intention of the president to have inserted in the\nNAEB News Letter each month a President’s Page, which will be one^\nor more pages long, and which will^ be Tnser^eH1 in the NL just\ninside the back cover. It will go to actives and associates\nIt ivi 11 not be bound in other copies of the NL. I think this ^ 1\nshould help us keep the members better informed, as well.y^plA^\nreasonably happy. /\nThe contents of this page do not need to be confined to\ncomments of the president. Some of you may have ideas or comments to\ninclude. The president is simply willing to accept the\nresponsibility9 and will prepare same each month.\nDeadline for each issue is 25th of month preceding month of\ndated publication. There was a slight change in deadline for December\nissue because of personnel reasons. Alsos we desired to get\ncommittee listings published and to all members.\n4. The headquarters now has its new mimeo machine. We are\nholding in abeyance purchase of hecktograph type of machine for the\npresent. We can still borrow.\ncc: Skornia"
