On their\nway to you are many materials with an earlier not© from me. This is the first\ninstallment in an effort to be sure you are completely oriented on everything\nwe are involved in. If you have any additional questions as a Board member,\npleas© let me have them and 1*11 do ay best to provide brief, honest answers.\nI expect, as Schooley has said, that the next year will be an important and\nin some respects a crucial arse. I want to be sure that you have all the back¬\nground necessary for the decisions which will need to be made concerning con¬\ntinuation of financial support for Headquarters, the many other projects in\nthe works, and relations of the HAEB with the JCET, NCCET, ETKC, and other\norganisations. I expect that Schooley will be calling a meeting to go over\nall these .matters as soon as the need for decisions and discussions justifies\nit. Until then our informal way of keeping you informed will be to send you\ncopies of everything important, frequently with hastily handwritten notes.\nLet us hear from you.\nHJStcp\nDunn\nAufcmis"
