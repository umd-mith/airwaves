X\nfurther suggested that while the amount indicated by the FCC presently\nwas nominal once the principle was established there is nothing to\nprevent the fee from becoming excessive and it violates in my opinbn—\nagain in principle—the freedom of access to communication facilities*\nIn other word®, I believe the principle is wrong notwithstanding the\nfact to some degree the matter is academicj it is academic for the\nreason anyone has to have money to get into thi® operation. However,\nfor marginal stations a 1,325*00 fee is a serious item.\nTours sincerely,\nRichard B* Hull\nDirector of Region IV\nRBHjdm\nccj Officers and Directors"
