It is only by the\nrelaxation of the Commission’s now stringent Rule that efficient\narxi flexible state-wide networks of non-commercial educational\nstations can be achieved*.\nThe filing of the reply came following informal discussions held\nbetween officers, counsel, engineering committee chairmen and the\nTV engineer. There may have been no formal Board action on this\nmatter but I assume there is practical unanimity on the desirability\nof this action."
