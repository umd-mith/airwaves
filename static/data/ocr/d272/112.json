  "text": "PROPOSED PLANS FOR\nPACKAGES #3 and #U\nTo start week of December 16\nLEGS\nIt is anticipated that the number of legs will be increased\nfor the issuing of Packages #3 and #1*® In this way then, there will be\na faster, smoother, and less troublesome distribution®\nThe question is, how many legs to establish® We are currently\nemploying eight legs® Normally, though not always, we duplicate three\ncopies at a time® This would indicate that the number of legs be in\nmultiples of three, especially since the present charge is the same for\neach run-through regardless of number of copies made® This would suggest\na very strong possibility of setting up twelve legs® The next lower mul¬\ntiple, nine, is not enough differect than the present eight to be much\nof an increase® Or, it would be possible to set up in between, at ten\nor eleven legs®\nOperationally it becomes a question of three of four-run-throughs\nper reel, for duplication® If more than nine copies are desired, it means\nfour run-throughs, so we might as well have twelve legs as far as the\noperation is concerned*\nHowever, there is a decided difference in number of tapes\nrequired* The followihg figures are based on 20 reels per issue of the\ntwo packages (per copy) and a 13 week duration* For nine legs this would\nrequire 23UO reels, for 10 legs, 2600 reels, and for 12 iegs 3120 reels®\nAt this point the only definite decision is to increase the\nnumber of legs®\nPROPOSED PROGRAM SCHEDULE FOR PACKAGES B and\nPACKAGE #3\nTitle Length\n51-17\nMusic for the Connoisseur\n60:00\nMusic\n13\n51-18\nMasterworks Story\n15:00\nMusic\n13\nSl-l?\nBach Memorial Concerts\n30s00\nMusic\n13\n51-20\nA Time for Planting\n30:00\nDocumentary\n13\n51-21\nStories *n Stuff\n30*00\nChildren\n13\n51-22\nCooper Union Forum:\nSears and Anxieties\n60:00\nTalk\n11\n51-23\nAmerica and the World:\nU of Denver Conference\n30:00\nTalk\n13\n51-21*\nMental Health\n15:00\nTalk\n13\n51-25\nBBC World Theatre\n60:00\nDrama\n13"
