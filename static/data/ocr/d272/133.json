It does not provide all the answers, but it is\nthe channel through which most of the answers can be made to\nwork.\nThe fact that we are expending large sxmx sums of foundation\nmoney places upon us a heavy responsibility. In view of the\nnew financial policy whereby stations pay for the service, this\nresponsibility is given added weight. If this spending of\nthe foundations and the station’s money is to be justified,\nit is essential that we make every effort to provide the\nmaximum of service.\nPresent Operation\n. TAPE SUPPLY- With the aid of the University of Illinois\npurchasing division we have temporarily, at least, solved the\nproblem of a supply of tape. The acquisition of 3,000\nreels of tape puts us in a momentarily comfortable position.\n2. Piling of master copies. We are accumulating a rather large\nsupply of tapes in our permanent file of programs. At the moment\nwe are sending out approximately 20 reels per week. In the course\nof a year this means over 1,000 reels of tape go into the files.\nThis doesn’t contribute much to the solving of the tape\nsupply situation.\n3. Technical quality. As of this moment, we are not capable\nof producing tapes of consistently excellent mechanical\nquality. Since this is an achievable goal, it seems legitimate\nfbr the stations to expect nothing but high quality tapes."
