The XOurth meeting will take place this year in\novamber in Minneapolis*\nIn the interim months, there will be a monthly meeting\nof the Steering Committee, which x designated as being the cfficers\nincluding Schooley, Paulu, Ausraus, you and myself* These meetings\nan take place either in Urbana or New York* You will recall that\nthe Board voted this Steering Committee full authority to, carry on\nthe business of the Kellogg Grant, subject to ratification of the\ncomplete Board*\nI also indicated that It would be desirable to have a\nweekly telephone conference between Urbana and New York, and including,\nif need be, Ansa, and possible, the University of Alabama. If the\nKellogg Grant cannot defray the cost of these meetings, then I am not\ncertain that the Grant can do the job it was designed to do*\nOur major problem, as always, has been one of an exchange\nof information and of communication* What I have suggested is logical\non all points, and if there should bo an expression of criticism, I am\nprepared to discuss this matter with anyone*\n, Insofar as Mike Hannah is concerned, his recent election\nto the HANTS Board merely emphasizes his position, end I assume that\nboth you and Paulu will be writing to him* Paulu to indicate that\nhie membership is now in the associate class, and you, on the basis of\nPaulu*s letter, withdrawing Network service*\nI have requested Paulu to furnish minutes of the meeting\nwhich will gnawer your question concerning the application of the\nOklahoma City Public School station KOKH-EM*\n(I presume that you will attend the meeting of the\nAmerican council on Education, along with Hull and myself, representing\nNAEB, on January 25th and 26th, in Washington* It would be advantageous\nalso to have Paulu present, but again tiie question of funds raises its\nugly head*\nI presume, also, that you will attend the UNESCO meeting\nin New York from January 27th to the SLst, and that you will got together\nwith Hick liull (who has been elected a member of the national Commission\nof UNESCO •• praise bel), to arrange for on exhibit by NAEB of a visual\ncharacter, at the conference*"
