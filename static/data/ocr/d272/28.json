  "text": "Shipping Containers\nExperimentation with shipping containers is still in\nprogress. The film cans have been abandoned. It v;as found that the\nlids of these cans too often pinched off a foot or two of tape. In\nsome cases part of the program was missing. They also get\nmashed out of shape rather quickly and thus there is added\ndanger of tape damage.\nWe are currently using fiber film shippers and cardboard\nwrappers which fit around the tape in its original box.\nA campaign has also been launched to get all stations to\nfasten the ends of the reels so that the tape doesnft unwind during\nshipment. Unwinding results very often in a pinched fold across the\ntape v/hich is soon followed by a break.\nShipping Labels\nAs mentioned earlier we have had to discontinue typing the\nshipping labels for all stations. A complete adriressograph service\nis available to the University and this is, perhaps, the best ultimate\nsolution to the label problem. It would also be possible to have labels\nprinted. We could also have a rubber stamp made for each station.\nThe addressograph plates could be used to address envelopes, so if\nthis service can be obtained at a moderate cost we will have the\nplates made.\nMail Service\nThe economy drive in the Post-Office Department has\nresulted in poor mail service. For example: It recently took seven\ndays for a tape to get to Toledo, Ohio from East Lansing, Michigan.\nIt took a tape two and a half weeks to get from Urbana, Illinois\nto Atlanta, Georgia 2\nExperience seems to indicate that this is not a general\noccurance, but it does happen rather frequently. The whole subject\nof the reliability of mail service needs further investigation. It\nmay be necessary to pay premium postage, change to Railway Express,\nor extend the time allowed for tape delivery. Neither of the last\ntwo possibilities seems desirable.\n-16-"
