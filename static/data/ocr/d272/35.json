  "text": "The problems encountered thus far can readily be\nsolved. Most of them are of a minor mechanical nature. We,\nof network headquarters, are completely sold on the potential\nof this operation. It has been necessary on occasion to\napologize for our shortcomings and our errors. But, we are\nproud, indeed, to be a part of such a challenging enterprise.\nThe administration of the Division of Communications of the\nUniversity of Illinois has accepted its custodianship of the\nnetwork seriously. The whole-hearted support of this institution\ncan be assured.\nWith the arrival of substantial financial aid, the future\nof the network is inspiring. It is impossible to see anything but\nsignificant achievement as the result.\nThe network headquarters, as now constituted, would like\nto go on record as thanking everyone concerned for the excellent\ncooperation, patience, and support that have been accorded our,\nas yet, feeble efforts. To all, our sincerest thanks.\n-21-"
