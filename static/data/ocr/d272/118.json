It might be mentioned\nthat one possible weakness with advisory groups in the past\nhas been the failure to include prospective listeners in\ntheir membership*\nRelationship of Radio and TV in a University\nOhio State University has applied for a television\nlicense* Much planning has preceded its application. Much\nmore planning will be needed before OSU can establish and\nput a television station into operation, assuming a tele¬\nvision license is issued. It is to be expected that re¬\nsponsible OSU officials would appreciate receiving information\nwhich would help them in the establishment and operation of a\nTV station.\nWe at WOSU assume that our primary responsibility is to\nextend the services of the university to adult Ohio listeners.\nShould this also be the chief concern of the television sta¬\ntion or should the TV outlet be used primarily as a training\nlaboratory for students aspiring to find work in television?"
