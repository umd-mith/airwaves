We suggest\nthe Adult Education Association of the United States of\nAmerica, the adult education department of the National\nEducational Association, and the office of the Specialist\nfor General Adult and Post-High School Education, United\nStates Office of Education*\nII* NETWORK GENERAL SERVICES\nOur discussion of general NAEB services includes both\nradio and television although only a handful of university\nstations now are active in television. We are hopeful that\nOhio State University eventually will be concerned with both\nbroadcast media.\nDetermining Audience Needs\nReturning to the adult education peoole mentioned\nearlier, perhaps these specialists also might be able to\nassist NAEB university station personnel to become better\nacquainted with some of the techniques for determing the\nadult education interests and needs in the geographical\nareas served by their stations. For example, one way to\nlearn adult education needs is to study census data in terms\nof identifying needs of various groups in the area covered\nby a radio station. BAging Successfully11 illustrates an\nappeal to a particular group...the older folks."
