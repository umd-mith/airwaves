I think you might be interested in a\nparagraph of a recent letter from Jim Miless\n\"The Tape Network Status Sheet is a good one. I had long held\nthat the tape attrition was at the rate of one per calendar day. Your\nfigures seem to say that it is a rate slightly in excess of one and a\nhalf per calendar day. Personally this doesn°t bother me a bit. How\nyou can handle as many tapes as you do with no more loss is and will con¬\ntinue to be a great wonder.* •\n1 Considering that we switched from the \"bicycle-leg\" system to\nthe \"direct service\" system a few months before Jim left this office, I\nam not surprised that the attrition rate has gone up slightly.\nOne major cause of loss has been the return of short tapes and\nbad tapes for good ones. A continual job here is the splicing together\nof short tape to fill-out reels. An occasional job is the inspection of\nall tapes on hand to separate the usable from the intolerably bad. I\npersonally have found returned tapes spliced with everything but barbed\nwire. Medical tape I have found!\nAs long &a we allow stations to trade tapes with us, asking\nonly that they return tape of comparable quality—and thus far this has\nseemed to be the best plan-many stations will prefer to return tapes not\nquite as good as they receive; a few will actually send better tapes—\nnew tapes. This attitude is \"only human\" and natural; but it can soon\ntake an unhealthy bite out of the stations9 mutual supply, the NAEB Net¬\nwork tape stock.\nBest personal regards\nSincerely,\nJRHswc\ncos Executive Director\nExecutive Officers\nBoard of Directors"
