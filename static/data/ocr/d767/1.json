I wonder if the\nbest solution for this would not be to pole the educa¬\ntional broadcasting field and choose the top two. As\nfar as our staff is concerned I would like to suggest\nBob Schenkkan, and on the regional consultant basis\nof course I would be available.\nHope this is what you want and see you in Wisconsin.\nSincerely yours.\nDirector, Region II"
