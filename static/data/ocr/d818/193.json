Actually these days are better\nfor both Sohooley and Skernia. There still remains\nthe possibility of Sohooley being tied up on our TV\ntrial on either one or both dates but this possibility\nis less remote than the 12th and 13th. At this hour\nI am scheduled to meet with Howbum, Steetle, and\nLowry on Monday, and I go on trial to be on the\nwitness stand on Tuesday, November 13*\nBest regards.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Sohooley\nPresident\nFEBjfmh\ncos Dr, Skornia"
