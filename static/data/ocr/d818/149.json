When we meet in a couple of weeks, you must tell me all\nabout your adventures.\nI wonder if you as NAEB president could do sane inquiring in\nWashington about the three NAEB Fulbrights. To date I’ve heard offi¬\ncially from Young confirming what he told us orally in Washington in\nMay, and I’ve had a letter from the University of London welcoming me\nto their midst for next year; but so far no official notification has\ncome from the State Department in spite of the fact that Young told us\nwe should get word within eight weeks of our meeting with him. With\npossible September departures, all of us shall be hard put to rent our\nhouses, pack and get off in time, in addition to which there is the\nmatter of arranging for our respectible jobs at home.\nI agreed with Hovey in Madison during the Lincoln Lodge meeting\nthat we should keep each other informed of developments; and since\nno letters have turned up from him, I assume he hasn’t heard anything\neither. So . . . could you call or wire Young or somebody in Washington\nand see if you can trace this down?\nI shall reserve a room for you in a Minneapolis hotel for the\nevening of August 1 and sbg.1 expect you to drive up with me leaving\naround 9s00 am on the 2nd.\nTil then. . .\nYours sincerely.\nBurton Paulu\nManager\nBPscjm"
