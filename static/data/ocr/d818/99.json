He would like me to wire him the names\nof those people this week* I would appreciate your having your\nsuggestions reacfcr by late Thursday afternoon so we may discuss\nthese by phone at that time and decide upon them.\nBob VanDuyn will meet with us on Friday to discuss the\nNAEB Kellogg Foundation relationships. I still wish it were possible\nfor you to be there but I understand your preoccupation with things\nat home. I assure you my own work here is suffering because of the\nnecessity of trips.\nAnother matter I should like a reaction to at a later\ndate is your recommendations concerning the future of JCET. I\nhave been invited to a \"JCET seminar11 in hew York on the 21st and\n22nd where plans for the future of JCET will be discussed in con¬\nsiderable detail by representatives of the constituent members.\nI shall rely very strongly upon the recommendations which you and\nSy will make to me. I assume that Ralph will invite Sy to this\nmeeting, also, and had hoped he would invite you, too. Give this\nsome thought and let me hear from you before too long.\nJ^y best wishes for your continued successful development\nof TV in Minnesota.\nVery sincerely yours.\nGraydon Ausmus\nPresident\nGA:pse"
