In looking ahead to the discontinuance of bicycling and the start of\nindividual station service, there appears to be several possible ways\nin which to offer programs. They could be offered in packages at set\nintervals such as twice a year, four tines a year, etc. They could be\noffered individually on a convenience basis, or at regular intervals.\nFor example, one proposal is that we offer one new series each week.\nThis has a nunber of possibilities®\nThe method of offering programs need not affect the manner in which\nthey are shipped. On the new operational plan, shipments can be made\neither by package, or individually. (See question 6.)\nFurthermore, if programs are offered in package there would be no\nobligation on the part of a station to accept all series in the pack¬\nage.
