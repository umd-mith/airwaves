I\nhave only several comments to make, end they don't go\nvery deep,\nSeveral times in the questionaire you refer to\nthe policy worked out by the Acceptance Committee, I\nknow that this has been circulated among the entire\nmembership so that everybody ought to have a copy. But s\nsince such things have a way of being mislaid, you might\ngive consideration to including a copy of that — or\nportions of it — in the rest of the questionaire.\nIn regard to section 1$: I think it a little\nimpractical to ask members to send along a list of all\ntheir recordings (point 5), since this may well run to\nseveral thousand items.\nRegion IV\nRICHARD B.
