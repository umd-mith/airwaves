The Jeffersonian Heritage,\nThey are tying this in with a display of the record\nalbum of the Jefferson series to make an attractive and\neffective promotional window.\nI should like to urge that you make a similar arrange¬\nment with your university or college bookstore. This\nis certainly an easy, effective, and mutually profitable\nsource of publicity for our first publication.\nSincerely yours.\nAdult Education Coimaittee, MSB\nGEPsN"
