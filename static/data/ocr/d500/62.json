Mr* Cleary*a question i® a long ways from another\nsuggestion he makes at the other end of the spectrum when\nhe says that what the series needs is \"more soap and less\nsuperficial attempts at a thorough-going academic cospre**\nhension of a society in four short programs.\" I should\npoint out that the series has as part of it the program\n\"The Sea-lion Flippers,\" which gives it a fifth program\non the problem ©f property rights, and which incidentally\nexplains that the reason men use their swe&thouses is to\nreduce their anxieties—which answers one of the queries\nasked by Mr. Cleary*\nFinally, it is perfectly true that ary of the \"Ways of\nMankind\" series can be made more \"popularised radio-wise\"\nby reducing the authenticating element of the contribution\nof the professional anthropologist. There was considerable\nbackground discussion ©£. this problem over a long period\nof time that led to th® decision represented in the\npresent compromise. We are very anxious to have the\nlistener believe these programs to bo true in addition\nto enjoying them because of their entertainment quality.\nWith the god, Wohpekusaeu, as narrator for the whole series,\nit would fee easy for the listener to set these stories\naside in the category of interesting fairy tales*\nSincerely yours.\nGeorge S.
