Harley\nPresident\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\nStation WHA-TV\nMadison, Wisconsin\nDear Bill:\nThank you for your note of January 9. I figured that\nSOMETHING LIKE YOU DESCRIBED HAD HAPPENED. I AM CERTAIN\nTHAT WE MADE GOOD USE OF BOTH RlDER AND BoUWSMA, BUT WE\nMIGHT HAVE GOTTEN ABOUT AS FAR WITHOUT THEM. I HAVE\nRECOVERED MY AIR FARE FROM THE UNIVERSITY, SO I WILL JUST\nHAVE A LITTLE TAXI BILL TO PRESENT# I HOPE RlDER HAS BEEN\nABLE TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR.\nI TALKED TO LARRY FrYMIRE ON THE TELEPHONE. We AGREED\nTENTATIVELY THAT THE REGISTRATION FEE WOULD BE $3.50. I\nTHINK THIS GIVES US ENOUGH CUSHION. I GUESS I * M SPOILED IN\nWORKING WITH OUR ADULT EDUCATION GROUP. I REALIZE THAT THIS\nIS OLD HAT TO THE MICHIGAN STATE CREW, BUT I SINCERELY HOPE\nTHAT WE NEVER GET TO THE PLACE WHERE PURDUE, AS THE HOST\nINSTITUTION, CANNOT SUPPLY TO PROFESSIONAL GROUPS THE\nNECESSARY CONFERENCE SERVICES ON A NO-COST BASIS. I AM SURE\nWE WILL HAVE A GOOD TIME AT MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, BUT\nIT GALLS ME A LITTLE TO SPEND OVER HALF OF OUR BUDGET IN\nCONFERENCE MANAGEMENT.\nNOW THAT THAT IS OFF MY CHEST, WE WILL GO BACK TO WORK\nWITH A REAL WILL. HOW DID YOU LIKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT?\nS I NCE.REL Y,\nDIRECTOR\nWBAA Radio - TV Unit\nJSM/rab\n$ WBAA (wo)"
