I certainly hope you can attend because we1re counting\non you to play an important role in the proceedings.\nThe Planning Committee for the Conference has sought to\nmaximize the opportunity that a regional meeting of this kind\npresents for a high degree of participation by the attendees by\nspliting the convention into three groups. Each group will be\nvisited in turn by three separate teams of discussants addressing\nthemselves to the general topic of the future in education of\nradio, television, and the NAEB, You have been named to the\nradio team.\nThe full membership of this group is as follows: McCabe\nDay, Vern McKown, H. B. McCarty, and Ed Burrows.\nThis letter is in the nature of an alert; details of your\nparticular responsibilities as a member of the team, the mechanics\nof the technique, and so forth, will be forthcoming.\nPlans for the Region III Conference are shaping up very\nwell and we can look forward to an excellent meeting in East\nLansing.\nVery cordially yours.\nWilliam G.
