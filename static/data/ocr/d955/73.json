Sulzer\ndirector\nRadio and Television Communications\nIndiana University\nBloomington, Indiana\nDear Mr. Gulzer:\nReceived your nice letter of April 6, upon my\nreturn from the National Association of broadcasters\nConvention, and would like to thank you for the pri¬\nvilege of working on the Public Relations committee.\nIn view of this, could you send me a one-line letter\njust telling me that I have been appointed to your\ncommittee? This brief note will be placed in the\nnext edition of the NAB Newsletter, which goes to ail\nour civic leaders.\nMv intention is to k ep these civic leaders\nposted as to our alliance with the NAEB. Their interest\nis very necessary to wha we would like to do. Phis can\nserve in a small way towards the solving of our first\nproblem, wh ch is to make known what and who the NAEB is\nto the public.\nTaking up the points mentioned:\n1) It would be impossible to paint the image of\nthe NAEB. Your behavior, your actions, your policies\nconstitute your image. An organization has a character\njust as a person does. The image, if there is one, should\nbe fluid. It should not be a stereotyped image at all.\nStereotyped images are objects of propagand \\ making a\nfluid image known by \"actions not words”, is education.\nSo my comment on this is that a concise statement of\nyour NAEB image woaid be a waste of time, inasmuch as\nthis statement would have to be amended from day to day."
