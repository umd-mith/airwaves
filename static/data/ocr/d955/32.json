People are wary of those things that are not tried, and\nthey shun away from things that are advocated as anything \"new\".\nEducational television is no longer new, nor is it untried, and we\nshould tell people this.\nIf possible, we should find and promote two or three people\nwho are excellent speakers and who are authorities in other fields.\nThen our public relations program should be set up in such a way as\nto give these people maximum exposure, which should include proper\npublic relations assistance in the field of speech writing, ghost\nwriters for newspaper articles, and arrangements for personal appear¬\nances in broadcasting studios and in lecture halls.\nIt is my opinion that a program of educating the young should\nbegin immediately. The greatest untapped source of strength for any\nmovement is usually found in the passing parade. This is the reason\nwhy big corporations concern themselves so much with teen-agers, and\nwhy the \"isms\"s Communism, Nazi-ism, Socialism, are so anxious to gain\ncontrol of our schools. It would benefit our cause to create a moving\ndisplay on trucks that could go into our cities and into our schools\nto show young people who have not been exposed to educational television\nwhat it can do and what the advantages would be to their schools if\nthey had it."
