Skomia, President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nMr. John E, White, President\nNational Educational Television & Radio Center\n10 Columbus Circle\nNew York 19, New York\nDear Sirs:\nThe big task facing educational radio and television is that of creating y\nan awareness in the public of our excellent programs. An idea on creating\nthis awareness has been \"bugging” me for a long time and I would like to\npass it along to you.\nI am sure you are familiar with \"National Pickle Week\", \"National Tavern Week\",\n\"National Education Week\" and a multitude of other national weeks; but in the\nyears I*ve been affiliated with educational television I can't recall a\nNational Educational Radio and Television Week.\nThis then is my proposal: The official designation of a National Educational\nRadio and Television Week.\nDuring the summer months educational programming, like it's counter-part-\ncommercial programming, takes a hiatus re-running familiar films and tran¬\nscriptions, a few live productions, but not too much, for the wealth of the\nproducers and directors energies are being funneled toward creating new\nexciting imaginative programming for the fall, winter, and spring months.\nMost fall programming begins in late September or early October, and I'm sure\nmany stations like us at WMSB, plan their fall programming to commence on the\nfirst of October,\nTherefore, I suggest the first week of October as National Education Radio and\nTelevision Week.\nIn undertaking such a venture the N.A.E.B. and N.E.T.R.C. working closely with\ntheir affiliates would strive to have all related elements enlighten the people\nof the United States to wealth of good informative programs to be viewed and heard\nover educational stations."
