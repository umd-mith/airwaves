Hunter, Director of Michigan State\nUniversityfs Broadcasting services, and he, like I, feel the idea has merit and\nfeel that the best possible month for such a week would still be the month of\nOctober when all the majority of educational radio and television stations\nnormally begin fall programming. Therefore, in planning for such a week it\nwould be wise to pick October, 1961, hence, a complete year to plan for such\na week.\nFor an operating budget perhaps agencies associated with television and radio\nin education would contribute funds, not to mention promotion in their own\nbaliwicks.\nSome of the agencies or educational organizations that might possibly con¬\ntribute are: NEA, American Association of Land-Grant Colleges and State\nUniversities, American Council on Education, National Educational Television\nand Radio Center, National Association of Educational Broadcasters, National\nAssociation of State Universities, National Congress of Parents and Teachers,\nNational University Extension Association, and possibly the Ford Foundation.\nOthers might be the American Book Publishers Council, American Library Associa¬\ntion, Department of Audio-Visual Instruction, Educational Film Library Association,\nElectronics Industries Association, National Audio-Visual Association, University\nFilm Producers Association, and Learning Resources Institute.\nAUG 1 2 I960\nk"
