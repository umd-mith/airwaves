In particular we\nbelieve these media have a special capacity for stimulating an Increased\nawareness of the common principles underlying a free society end for help¬\ning education develop a citizenry capable of perpetuating the ideals end\npractices fundamental to the life of our nation. But the potential of these\nmiraculous Instruments will not be realized to more than a fraction of their\ncapabilities, unless a true profession is created to use them and guide their\nuses in sducauon at all levels.\nWith the need for such a profession becoming increasingly apparent\nand urgent, we would be remiss If we did not make the effort to dramatise\nthe need and take the Initiative in securing the resources and developing\nthe mechanism for bringing It into being."
