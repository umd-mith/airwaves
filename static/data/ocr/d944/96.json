Acceptance of educational radio writing as a profession, with recog¬\nnition of professional status, particularly important to some of\nthe writers new to the field.\n8) Ideal organization, and unsurpassed friendliness and hospitality on\nthe part of the hosts: Superintendent Hickey, Miss Golterman, Miss\nFleming, and the entire staff of KSLH.\nDespite the success of the Seminar, as attested by the evaluations submitted\nby the members of the Seminar, most of them anonymously, it was felt by both staff\nand members that a number of modifications in procedure might make future Seminars\nfor radio writers even more profitable to the participants. The most frequently\nmentioned of these modifications, as suggested by staff and members, follow:\nA) Allowing more time, if over-all time-table of the pre-Seminar period per¬\nmits, for the selection of candidates. In addition, brief them and learn\nmore about their backgrounds. (Parenthetically, it is interesting to\nnote that this is exactly what was done with another and subsequent NAEB\nWorkshop — the TV Production Workshop held at WKAR-TV, Michigan State\nCollege, August 23-September 10, 195&. Summaries of qualifications, ex¬\nperience, background, current assignments and probably future activities\nin educational TV, were made available by the Selection Committee to\nthose in charge of the Workshop some two weeks before the Workshop began.\nSuccessful applicants were requested to read the published report of a\nprevious Workshop in the same pattern before reporting for duty.)"
