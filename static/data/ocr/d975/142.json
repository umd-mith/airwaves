Though\n\"multiplexing\" is only applicable to the FM\nradio spectrum, it can be an extremely valuable\ndevice in those areas where FM is available\n(i.e., in Northern California, with the Pacifica\nStations). What this means, in simple terms,\nis that if an FM station went into a sub-carrier\nsituation, one of those radio channels could be\nmade available to a Community Action Agency, at\na greatly reduced rate from what it would be if\nthere were only the full power station available.\nIt provides wider capability where, formerly,\nonly one outlet existed.\nIn the area of television communication, the most\nrecent development, in systems engineering, and\nin the opening up of greater channel capability,\nhas been the emergence of the ITFS (Instructional\nTelevision Fixed System). This system operates\nin the 2500 me range, and is not unlike the\nClosed Circuit television system, with the ex¬\nception that it is a broadcasting capability,\nand the closed circuit system does not use the\nairwaves. What is unique about ITFS is the fact\nthat it, like the concept of radio multiplexing,\noffers a multi-channel capability. It is ob-"
