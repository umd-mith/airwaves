Washington is the only one\nof the sixteen great cities in the country that does not make regular\nuse of television in its schools. It is encouraging to note, however,\nthat the D.C. Schools recently formally indicated its intention to\ndevelop an Instructional Television Fixed Service 4-channel system in\nthe near future. ( Dr. Manning has written letters on these plans to\n*\nthe FCC and to HEW. )\nWe must see the child in his present and future world; and we\nmust also begin to see the teacher in the world like it is and not like\nit once was.\nLet me say this: It is educationally blasphemous, economically\ncorrupt and slanderous to human dignity and capability to permit a\nstudent to ‘be taught such things as parts of speech, factual information\narithmetic\nlanguage memorization and/drill by a live teacher in a classroom—when\nthat kind of teaching can be done at least as effectively by currently\navailable educational media, enabling the instructor to be free to\nwork with the students in their thinking, in their aesthetic development\nin their moral growth. We should at least have enough respect for our\nteachers to grant that they can do things beyond that which machines\ncan do, and we should cease using them as though they were machines.\nWe should free our youth in the classroom from the excess time needed\nfor factual learning so that they may devote that time to their\nfulfillment as non-mechanized human beings; not memorizing, but creating"
