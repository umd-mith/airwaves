' Some of us have reservations about being here.\nI thought about this a good deal, as I know all of you have.\nBecause what I am going to talk with you about today relates to some of\nthe- goals and needs that Senator- Robert F. Kennedy dedicated his\nlife to, because some of WJicif; 1 want to say to you directly\nconcerns the events of the past few days-and their meaning for us\nall, I am not only willing to be here, but grateful to you for the\ninvitation that allows me to be here to talk with you about these\nthings. •\nThank you, Lou /Kornhauser/ for your very generous introduction.\n- I have an additional confession to make. I have a Ph.D—in education.\nI have an even worse confession to make. 1 went to Teachers\nCollege, Columbia.\nAnd what’s worse--I liked it.\nAnd the most terrible thing of all--I did post-doctoral work at\nT.C. in curriculum and administration.\nNow all this should clearly disqualify me from addressing you here\n- #\ntoday as a government official. Because, on paper, at least, I should\nknow what I’m talking about.\nBut don’t be fooled by credentials. I’ll disabuse you of that by\nsaying right off that I believe John Dewey was right. That’s enough\nto alienate at least half of any crowd, in education or out."
