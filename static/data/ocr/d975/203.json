I do wish to make it clear that what I say will be my\npersonal comments and does not reflect endorsement or approval by\nthe FCC of the Federal Interagency Broadcast Committee.\nWith all of your reading and discussing of the Public Broad¬\ncasting Act and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, I wonder if\nyou have had the chance to relate this new development in American\ncommunications to your own stations, to your own operations, to\nyourselves? What does the Corporation’s purposes mean in terms of\nyour educational radio station, for example--whether it is 10 watts\nor 50,000 watts.\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting, in my mind, should not\nand will not be a superagency hidden in that never-never land across\nthe Potomac River, creating new communications clothes for 200 million\nemperors. It will have to deal with very real needs--and very real\nresources. You are part of those resources. The Corporation for\nPublic Broadcasting is not going to revolutionize broadcasting, it is\nnot going to replace what we now have. What it is going to do is to\nprovide the wherewithal to make educational broadcasting more meaning¬\nful, to permit it to provide the services in full breadth and depth\nthat heretofore have been limited by' inadequate funds."
