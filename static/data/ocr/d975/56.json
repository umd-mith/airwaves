  "text": "-4-\nUniversity13 celebrated Clinic for Learning in a junior high school\nin Brooklyn’s Bedford Stuyvesant area \"got the hell kicked out of us\"\nand abandoned its efforts. It is no accident that the millions upon\nmillions of dollars being poured into special education for disadvan¬\ntaged children by and large produce little or no positive results.\nAll children, today, including and maybe especially the ghetto\nchild, live in an aural and visual world. Yet, virtually every\neducation program in the country is rooted in the print world of fifty\nyears ago. How can we expect any child to learn when we continue to *\nuse nineteenth century methods and techniques to try to solve the\neducation problems that are rooted in the twentieth century revolutions\nof energy, transportation and--especially--communications?\nThe media change not only the content, but the entire behavior*\nand learning and growth patterns of our children and even of adults.\nThe child entering school who has watched TV--even non-selectiveiy--\nis much better informed, all other things being equal, then the child\nwho hasn’t watched TV. (A child has watched some three to four\nthousand hours of TV by the time he has entered the first grade.) But\ninformation is the least important of it. More important is the child's\nspecial awareness of visual observation and learning, his abilities\nto relate non-immediate, mediated experiences to live experiences and\nto print description, his openness to the utilization of media for\nlearning development as well as being able to sit--maybe rightfully\nimpatiently and uncomfortably--at the other end of the educational log."
