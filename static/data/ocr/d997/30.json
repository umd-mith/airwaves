Brubeck and some of the moderns certainly\nhave numberous intense followers, but here again, the\nnumber is limited. I’m certain that most of us can\nproduce good jazz programs without a lot of the narrative\nclaptrap that goes into programs of this ilk. \"Roots of\nJazz” has other flaws in addition to what I consider its\ninherent ones. The commentators are unskilled and there\nare s*xious gaps in continuity, etc. I fear this fifth\nreally flatted for me. gg.\nJim Slack\nNetwork Acceptance Subcommittee"
