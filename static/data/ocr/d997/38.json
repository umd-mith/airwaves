There are many fine things4n the audition tapes I\nheard, but I am not entirely satisfied with them. It seems\nto me that \"Six to Sixty\" for example, is rathe£>confusing.\nI was never sure whether or no;\nto the entire nation or simpl^/t:onto:\nseemed to me that the level some\npretty bad. Again, I thought the\na trifle maudlin.\nstatistics I heard applied\nCountry. It also\nthe homey voices is\nroduction too long and\nI would like to see expanded into a program\nexplaining the \"joysH, **eaW\\ an&'\\« hopes* of all the farmers,\nnot merely those id Contour Country. It seems t© me that the\nformat, as established by the] beople at WOI, is flexible enough\nto do this withoutla great d^ai of additional effort. As it\nis heard now.
