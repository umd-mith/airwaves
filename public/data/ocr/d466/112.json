VanDuyn\nThis is to inform you that Earl Vfynn has indicated his\ninterest in being considered for the job of Executive Director\nand will be available, if given favorable consideration by the\norganization, January 1, 195>3, but not before that date.\nBy way of references - and X believe Frank was to trace\nreferences on Vfynn - he lists the followings\nDr. Robert Burton House, Chancellor Gov. Kerr Scott\nUniversity of North Carolina State House\nChapel Hill, North Carolina Rawleigh, North Carolina\nDr. Frank P. Graham\nU.S. Representative to the U.N.\nUnited Nations Assembly\nNew York, New York\nX regret that I have no lead on the two or three other\nnames which I was to explore but am still, working on the list.\nThe question this committee should consider at this point\nis whether to attempt a meeting prior to the convention to\ninterview one or two possible candidates or wait until that\nmeeting to get together. If members of the committee feel that\nwe have made enough progress on the names at the top of our\nlist, that is if we have enough information on Bro, Morris,\nWynn, Peterson, and others, to narrow the list down to not\nmore than three people and have these three people meet with\nus, then I feel we should have a meeting by the middle of\nOctober so that we can come up with a specific recommendation\nat the November convention. I should like to have an expression\nfrom members of this committee as soon as possible •\nPRESIDENT\nSEYMOUR N.
