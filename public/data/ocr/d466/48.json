I would be happy to appoint\nPaulu, but X don't see how he can be effective from Minneapolis*\nAn observer is someone who Is on hand all the time, and can\ndevote many hours to keeping au courrant with the work of the\nUnited Nations* Do you have any other ideas?\nTour letter concerning the Board meeting at Columbus\nposes several problems which I feel you will have to solve for\nyourself* I think it advisable to have the first meeting of the\nBoard on Wednesday afternoon or evening, and keep at least one\nfull day over that* Insofar as Committee meetings are concerned,\nthis would be up to the individual chairmen* As soon as you set\nthe time for the Board meeting, and let them know about It, they\nwill have to work out their own time schedule for Committee\nmeetings*\nIt would certainly be an ideal thing if Kellogg could\ndefray the cost of the meeting of the Board, but you know the\nsituation as well as I do* It is entirely possible and likely\nthat only the Executive Director's expenses will be paid. These\nare matters, of course, which might be discussed at Norman*\nBy all means, go ahead and set up the time of the Board\nmeeting, and send out notices. It is not likely that I will be\nin Columbus, so you've got the full load of running the show.\nAs soon as I get word from Bob Hudson, I'll let you\nknow about inviting Scott Fletcher to talk to the Board, and\npossibly to appear on the luncheon program along with Paul Walker*\nWith best wishes.\nCordially,\nSeymour N* Siegel\nPresident\nsns/t"
