  "text": "Host music was borrowed, recorded or transcribed„ and no charge\nwas indicated, There were only two instances cf special expenditures\nfor music. These range from $2,50 to $5.00.\nProgram art was mostly indicated as being produced by th©\nstudents and staff, and nearly all costs were for materials* Th©\ncosts of materials ranged from $5*00 to $150*00 with most costs\nreported averaging between $5,00 and $10,00 per program. This is\nanother instance of the possibility of hidden costs as most of\nthe work involved in thi3 department would take a great deal of\nstaff time and effort. However, it is only fair to note that in\nmany instances an elaborate piece of art work may be used and refused\nmany times with slight modification, thereby reducing the present\nprogram costs.\nMost talent was reported as being donated. The largest cost\nin this department was apparently for transportation and food.\nHowever, some instances were reported where faculty members received\nas high as $25*00 per program for their efforts. These were rare\ninstances and usually involved a great deal of effort on th© part\nof the faculty member. In other instances faculty members were\nreported as having their work equalized by dropping classes or taking\ntime off from other assignments * but in most instances the efforts\nof the faculty were considered as a donation from the institution to\nthe total effort of educational broadcasting. There were some\nprograms which required hired dancers (professionals) - it was indicated\nthat such professionals cost $25*00 each per program."
