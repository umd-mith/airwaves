  "text": "Mr. Harry Wilklow\nPage ^\nApril 2h, 1956\nsince many in-school stations are not on the air during the summer months,\nsuch stations are allowed to substitute the in-school programs for regu¬\nlar programs they would receive during the summer, and thus pay no addi¬\ntional fee for the in-school service. If a station owned and operated by\na school or school system prefers to subscribe to only the in-school pro¬\ngrams, they may do this under a modified agreement. In this case, the sta¬\ntion gets all in^school programs, plus one hour a week from the regular\nNetwork offerings, for one-half the fee they would normally pay for the\nfull service. Of course, the conditions regarding postage payments re¬\nmain the same.\nIf, after youfve had a chance to look over the materials you have any\nquestions about the NAEB, or if we can be of further service in helping\nyou get your station on the air, please let me know.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director"
