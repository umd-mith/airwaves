Of course. Associate and Affiliate\nmembers do not receive as many of these materials as regularly as Active\nmembers do.\nIn addition. Active members with radio stations may use the facilities of\nthe NABB Radio Network upon payment of an annual assessment fee. The Net¬\nwork distributes approximately eight hours of programming, by tape record¬\ning, weekly, to members subscribing to its service. This fee is also based\non power (with the same power classifications as membership) and a new sta¬\ntion does not have to pay the full fee until the third year it is in the\nNetwork. The fees are:\n2nd year\nrm^r\n375.00\n22$.00\n1st year\nIIOTTflO\"\n2$0.00\n1$0.00\n3rd year\nfOTTKT\n$00.00\n300.00\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nStations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to and from\nNetwork Headquarters here in Urbana, Illinois. Still even a Class A sta¬\ntion paying its full third-year rate is paying only a little over $2.00\nan hour for better than 1*00 hours of programming from the Network in a\nyear. This is about the most inexpensive programming a station can do.\nIf, after looking over the materials which we shall send you, you have fur¬\nther questions, we shall be most happy to answer them.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director"
