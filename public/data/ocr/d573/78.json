The Network\ndistributes approximately eight hours of programming, by tape recording, weekly,\nto members subscribing to its service. This fee is also based on power (with the\nsame power classifications as membership) and a new station does not have to pay\nthe full fee until the third year it is in the Network. The fees ares\n1st year\n$400.00\n250.00\n150.00\n2nd year\n$600.00\n375.00\n225.00\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nStations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to and from Net~\nwork Headquarters here in Urbans, Illinois. Still even a Class A station\npaying its full third-year rate is paying only a little over $2.00 an hour far\nbetter than 400 hours of programming from the Network in a year. This is about\nthe most inexpensive programing a station can do.\nIf, after looking over the materials which we shall send you, you have further\nquestions, we shall be most happy to answer them.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEHidfc"
