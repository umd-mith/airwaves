  "text": "TV Production In St. Louis\nFather Murphy Reports Pressure\nTremendous\nFather Eugene P. Murphy, S.J., and\nhis staff have found the weekly produc¬\ntion of the Sacred Heart TV program\nsuch a grinding ordeal that they re-or¬\nganized their whole set-up and made\nFather Hugh Harkins, S.J., producer-\nmanager of the TV program. What\nFather Schwienher does for the Sacred\nHeart radio transcription—this Father\nHarkins will do for the weekly films. At\nTechnisonic Studios, as technical advisor,\nMr. Charles Harrison, now produces 100\nSacred Heart transcriptions daily, and 10\nSacred Heart films weekly. Stress is be¬\ning placed on mastery of their topic and\neasy, convincing and pleasant delivery of\ntheir materials by each of the TV speak¬\ners. Buffalo friends will be glad to know\nthat Father Charles Dolan, S.J., of the\nCanisius High School faculty did two ex¬\ncellent films while in St. Louis recently.\nThese will be seen on our WGR program\nsoon. Congratulations to Fr. Murphy and\nMr. Harrison!\nFATHER TWIGG-PORTER, S. J.\nGrand News from San Francisco\nFrom our San Francisco offices comes\nword that Father George Twigg-Porter,\nS.J., has been appointed full-time direc¬\ntor of the Program on the West Coast.\nFather has just finished his long course\nof training as a Jesuit. To date he has\nbeen only able to devote what free time\nwas available over and above his studies\nand teaching, to the Sacred Heart Pro¬\ngram. Father brings enthusiasm and out¬\nstanding ability to his assignment. His\nappointment is good news—and is one of\nthe finest assurances we have had in re¬\ncent years that the Program will go for¬\nward in the years ahead.\nCHRISTMAS NOVENA\nPRAYER\nDECEMBER 16-24\nLet us pray, Hasten, we be¬\nseech Thee, O Lord, do not de¬\nlay, and grant us the assistance\nof Thy grace from above that\nwe who confide in Thy good¬\nness, may be aided by the con¬\nsolation of Thy coming, Who\nlivest and reignest with the\nFather and the Holy Spirit,\nGod, world without end. Amen.\nN. B. Please join us in making this No¬\nvena in preparation for the coming of Our\nInfant Saviour. If unable to join us on the\nradio, recite the above prayer privately,\nDecember 16 to 24. Kindly return enclosed\nintention slip by December 24.\nR.I.P.\nIn your kindness please remember\nthe souls of the following good friends\nof the Sacred Heart Program, recently\ndeceased: Rev. Harold B. Hinds, Rev.\nArthur R. Campbell, S.J., Mrs. Eliza¬\nbeth B. Burke, Mrs. Elizabeth Smith,\nMiss Alma Mary Cotter.\nFATHER HINDS\nOn October 11, 1955, our Sacred Heart\nProgram lost its beloved and devoted\nfriend, Father Harold B. Hinds, pastor of\nSt. John Baptist Church, Schenectady.\nThat morning Father Hinds went to re¬\nceive the reward of his manifold aposto-\nlates—not the least of which was his\nsponsoring of our Sacred Heart Program\nin the Albany diocese for fifteen years.\nOne of the memorials to Father is the\nCo-missionaries of the Sacred Heart, a\ngroup of over 200 shut-ins in the area\nwho devote their prayers, joys and suf¬\nferings to the Sacred Heart apostolate.\nThey are under the direction of Miss\nMargaret Mullarkey in Schenectady,\nfrom whom they receive a letter each\nmonth. May he rest in Peace!\nHOME STUDY COURSE\nJohn McGrath, S.J., Looks for Applicants\nFr. John McGrath, S.J., director of our\nSacred Heart correspondence course, re¬\nports that a full corps of theologians\nhave volunteered to conduct instructions\non the Catholic Faith by mail. He says\nthey can take on seventy more applicants.\nPerhaps you know a non-Catholic who\nwould like to take such a course.\nSend names to: Home Study Course,\nWeston College, Weston 93, Mass.\nInstructions are free of charge.\nDIRECTOR’S COLUMN\n(Continued from Page 1)\neast area alone, i.e., in New York and\nthe New England States. If all of us\ncontinue to give as we have in dona¬\ntions, promotional work, labor, prayers\nand sufferings, we’ll keep growing and\nkeep paying our way as we grow.\nPlease join us in our Christmas novena\nfrom December 16 to December 24. It\nwill be on 31 stations in this northeast\narea. There is so much commercialism in\nour preparation for the coming of the\nChrist-Child that we should join in such\na fervent novena so as to offset this sad\ntendency. On page four you will find\nour novena prayer.\nGod Bless you with a most Happy\nChristmas and a Bright New Year.\nMatthew Hale, S.J.\nTHE DIME-A-WEEK CLUBS\nGrand Subsidy for Sacred Heart\nProgram\nAgain our all-out thanks go to our Sa¬\ncred Heart Dime-a-Week Clubs. Very\nmany new members have joined the ranks\nas Captains and Ptomoters. The figures\nquoted below for each club speak for\nthemselves. As the Sacred Heart will\nnever be outdone in generosity, they be¬\nspeak a rich reward. May we not con¬\nsider the dime each associate gives each\nweek as the cup of cold water given in\nHis Name of which our Lord said: it “will\nnot go without its reward.” On account of\nthe floods the annual meeting of our\nzealous Connecticut Clubs had to be post¬\nponed.\nD.A.W.

Over 300 have joined the league in the parish and\nattend the weekly Holy Hour there. The goal is 1000 members."
