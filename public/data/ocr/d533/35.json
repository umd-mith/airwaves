In checking through it,\nI had one reaction which may be worth passing along to you. The election\nof the members of the Board last fall seems to me to have disregarded\nthe statement of tenure regarding Board members in the various districts.\nIt might be worthwhile to ask Burton, as secretary, to review the status\nof our present members of the Board and enclose a note in the next\nNewsletter stating which are in for two years at the present time and\nwhich w0br'rs come up for re-election the next time.\nI still have received no information from Dick for our new brochure\non NAEB. I shall draweup, within the next two or three days, a statement\non it and send it to you. I also expect to complete within the next two\nor three days a letter to all regional directors urging them to start a\ncampaign for new members. , I am keeping a check on new applications and\nCPs in the educational field and shall begin forwarding to each regional\ndirector notices that come up concerning his region.\nCongratulations upon your answer to Gould’s January 23 story on the\nSmythe-IIorton survey. It was a very thoughtful and pointed reply and\nwas beautifully written* May I say, you continue to amaze me.\nWy best always.\nGA/ns\nGray don Ausmus, Director\nRadio Broadcasting Services\nManager, *VUOA(FM)"
