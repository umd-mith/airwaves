  "text": "In Brussels Larry and I served as American observers at a meeting of\ntelevision experts arranged by the Brussels Treaty Organization to dis¬\ncuss educational television. In Paris the three of us spent a week to¬\ngether* in the course of which we had a chance to see how successfully\nLarry persuaded the French broadcasters to translate some of our\nJeffersonian Heritage scripts for use on the French network. Larry was a\nwell chosen man for France. He speaks good French* and clearly has\nestablished good rapport with the French broadcasters.\nBut now to talk about broadcasting in the United Kingdom. It was my\nassignment to study British broadcasting. Accordingly I watched BBC tele¬\ncasts* listened to BBC radio programs* talked to many key members in the\norganization and read widely about it. I also distributed to BBC personnel\nas well as to British educators* various NAEB documents and pamphlets.\nWith Harry Skornia*s assistance I got a number of American publishers to\nprovide me with copies of their books on American radio and television for\ndistribution to the American Embassy library in London and the BBC Library.\nThose are the places to which British scholars go for data about American\nbroadcasting* so I thought they should have publications of this sort. In\nJuly I was one of the three American delegates at a UNESCO-sponsored tele¬\nvision producers* seminar which met in London*\nThree Distinctive Features about BBC\nThere are three distinctive things about the BBC: it is a public\ncorporation; it has a monopoly on broadcasting in the United Kingdom; and\nit is financed through receiver set license fees. The BBC system works\nwell over there* although I don*t think it would be successful in America.\n13"
