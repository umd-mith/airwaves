Kellogg Foundation\nBattle Greek* Michigan\nDear Bobs\nAs Dr, Seay may have told you* I had the pleasure of meeting him and\nvisiting the Kellogg Foundation for the first time a week ago today* when I was\non my way through Battle Creek from other meetings, X°m sorry it was at a time\nwhen you weren«t yet back* but hope X may pass that way again soon. Although X\nimagine this finds you still in the unpacking stage* X thought it might be desir¬\nable as soon as possible to get before you one rather limited request which might\naffect next y©ar°s grant.\nThis specifically concerns the fact that we now have an Associate\nDirector* Harold E. Hill* as a part of the regular Headquarters8 staff. By the\nbeginning of the next fiscal year* Harold will have been with u© approximately\na year and a half. However, unless budgetary provision for his salary can be\nadded to the earlier approved Kellogg grant expected for the 1955*56 fiscal year*\nw® should have to drop Harold a year before the expiration of the rest of the\npresent Kellogg grant,\nX believe that by the end of the year and a half he will have served\nby the end of June* Harold will deserve a rale© in salary,, I hop© to recommend\nto the directors an increase of something on the order of $800,00* for an annual\nsalary of $8*000,00 per year. Adding to this the $623,20 retirement and $120,00\nworkmen0a compensation charges which the budget would also have to carry* this\nwould make a total of $8*743*20* not including any administrative charge* which\nI am sure we could absorb.\nInasmuch as X feel we owe it to Harold to know what the prospects are\nfor the coming year as soon as possible* X hop© you do not mind my request for an\nopinion on this matter as scon as possible. Granting it would not be. interpreted\nas a decision on the part of the W. K# Kellogg Foundation to extend its commit¬\nments beyond the period already decided upon. For this more basic problem I am\nsure we all agree more time and more fundamental examination of all the issues\nand possibilities involved will be necessary.\nAt the time of this more intensive series of discussions X believe it\nextremely desirable for us to take up with you in greater detail than has hereto¬\nfore been done the matter of the Washington office which the NAEB hopes to sat up"
