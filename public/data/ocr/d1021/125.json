'When humidity is mentioned, as in talking about\nweather, it is usually relative humidity that is meant. Relative humidity is the\nratio between the amount of water the air is actually holding at a certain tem¬\nperature and the amount it could hold at this temperature. It is always expressed\nin a per cent, as a relative humidity of 70 per cent, which means that the air is\nholding ^0 per cent as much moisture as it can. Warm air can hold more moisture\nthan cold air can. A hygrometer is an instrument used to find the relative\nhumditity of the atmosphere. A recording hygrometer is a hygrograph.'\nThings to Do;\n1. Use twro jars of water, one open and one sealed, to show how water evaporates\ninto the air.\n2. Note the condensation on a glass of ice water, to see how moisture condenses\nfrom the air.\n3* Determine relative humidity with a simple wet-and-dry-bulb thermometer.\nSources:\n1.

Weather is an important part of our lives.\n2. Weather forecasting is valuable in many ways.\n3. Weather maps help to make forecasting correct.\nIn almost everything we do, we are better off if we know what the weather is\ngoing to be. Weather prediction is so valuable that the United States government\nspends much money each year to study and forecast the weather. Important weather\n-5-"
