  "text": "TO: NAEB BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nReport No. 4\n12-1-54\nFrom:\nFrank E. Schooley\nRe: Subscription Television\nI’m stamping this letter \"confidential\" because I believe our\nposition a3 an Association should be roughly \"no\" decision,\nno action now.\nOn basis of Board members who have voted, on advice of TV Development\nand Engineering Committee members, and on advice of counsel, I\nsuggest our position should be, and so far as I am concerned, will\nbe9 to sit by and watch developments for the present.\nOnly two Board members think we should presently get involved. Four\nthir.k definitely that we should not. Two believe we should sit and\nwait. Two not voting. Others have not yet replied. Counsel\nbelieves the fight is one of commercial interests, and unless other\nfactors unknown to him change picture, we would be better on the\nsidelines, watching.\nThus, Report 4, now ends consideration of Inquiry No. 1. I thank\nyou for your responses. For the present, the matter is closed.\ncc: H. J. Skoraia\nCohn Sc Marks"
