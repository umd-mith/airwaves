Illinois\nHEADQUAETERS\n914 East Green Street\nPasadena 1, California\nJanuary 8, 1954\nMi*. H, J. Skornia\nExecutive Direotor\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n119 Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr. Skorniat\nYou may recall that this past year the Fund for Adult Education\nestablished an annual lectureship in this field. The first lectures were\ngiven this fall by Lyman Bryson at Madison, Milwaukee and Wausau, Wisconsin.\nThe tapes that were made of these lectures have been rebroadcast a number of\ntimes by the University of Wisconsin and Mr. Blakely has suggested that the\nNAEB might wish to add the tapes to the stockpile they have available for the\nNAEB tap© network.\nI have talked to Bob Hudson about the matter. He has said that if\nwe will send the tapes to the Educational Television and Radio Center at Ann\nArbor, they will audit and edit them so that they will be in suitable shape\nfor use by the network. In their present form the tapes include rather lengthy\nintroductions which are probably geared too closely to the specific occasion\nof each of the addresses. Moreover, they also include th© questions and answers\nthat formed a part of the public forum part of the program.\nI shall appreciate hearing as to whether or not you would like to\nhave us send somewhat shortened and edited tapes of these speeches.\nVery sincerely yours,\nFHD/ss\nCopy Made l-13-54«\n/&/ Paul H. Durri©\nExecutive Associate"
