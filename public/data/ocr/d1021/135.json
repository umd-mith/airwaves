Granite is a common igneous rock.\nThe outer surface of the earth is made up of rocks and soils, formed in\ndifferent ways over long periods of time. Rocks are made of minerals, generally\na mixture of many minerals. Igneous rocks are those formed from molten rock, such\nas basalt and granite. Sedimentary rocks are made of sediments which have been\npressed together and hardened. Examples of sedimentary rocks are limestone,\nsandstone, and shale. Metamorphic rocks are those changed from igneous or\nsedimentary rocks by heat and pressure. They include such rocks as quartzite,\nslate, and marble.\nThings to Do:\n1. Make a collection or demonstration table of rock samples — arrange according\nto the three main rock groups.\n2. Crack rocks and observe the crystals.\nSources:\n1.

Soil is very important to the life of man.\nSoil is one of man’s most important natural resources. It is necessary for\nthe existence of plants, and all animals depend directly or indirectly on plants\nfor food. Soil is formed by the decay of rock, ’^feathering” is the breaking down\nof rocks into smaller bits and finally into soil. Weathering is largely the work\nof the atmosphere, since it contains the gases and water which do the weathering.\nWeathering is either chemical or mechanical. New soil is constantly being formed.\n-15-"
