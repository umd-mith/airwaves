The motion of the matter is an\nexpression of the energy as force, whereas, the balance of\nthis energy results in no expression of force.\nNumber 2 Matter has weight, takes up space, and is com¬\nposed of atoms and the smal ler atomic particles.\nThe substance of the universe is matter.\nNumber 3 Energy. Equilibrium exists when energy com¬\nponents are equal or balanced. Force exists\nwhen energy components are not equal.\nPremise: Few things exist in isolation „ One regularity in main is the\nconstant interaction of living and non-living things.\nNumber 4 Interaction of things represents interdepend¬\nence .\nNumber 5 The structure of living things . From our obser¬\nvations we see that matter of living things is\norganized in systems: environments, organisms,\norgans, tissues, cells, and molecules.\nD-18"
