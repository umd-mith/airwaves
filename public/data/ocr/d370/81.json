  "text": "Critics are quick to claim that the fellow\nwho tries to translate education into dollars-\nand-cents terms really wants to cheapen it.\nThey take the position that while automation\nin office and factory may be beneficial, auto¬\nmation in the classroom simply will not work.\nThey seem to forget that the biggest for¬\nward surge in the history of education was\nbrought about by automation — in the form\nof the printing press. Then, for the first time,\noutstandingly gifted teachers were able to set\ndown their ideas in books that spread their\nwisdom and influence far beyond the narrow\nreach of their personal contacts. It is well to\nremember that the book is one of the most\nimportant products of automation in the his¬\ntory of man.\nThe fact is that education has now become\nour biggest business. It has an annual budget\nof $20 billion, and more employees and a\nlarger “plant” than either the steel or auto\nindustry.\nIn industry, over the past half century, out¬\nput per man-hour has shown a steady increase.\nThis increase has been due basically to our\nskill in working out constantly better methods,\nand providing more and better tools to back\nup each worker.\nExperience suggests that we can multiply\nthe effectiveness of the good teacher with im¬\nproved methods and appropriate tools, just as\nwe have multiplied the effectiveness of the\nfactory worker, the office worker — everybody\nright up to and including top management.\nIn fact, just as the printing press did.\nThere are now available a wide variety of\nnew tools and techniques for improving the\nquality of our educational system. Foremost\namong them, of course, is television.\nClosed-circuit installations are extending\nthe influence of talented teachers from one to\nseveral classrooms.\n4"
