Harley,\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters,\n1119 DuPont Circle Office Building,\n131*6 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.,\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Bills\nI am returning herewith the copy of the NAEB\nproposal to the Ford Foundation that you lent me in South Carolina.\nI found it very helpful in providing further insight to the kinds\nof activities NAEB would like to undertake if financial support\nwere available. I appreciate, of course, the problems which ac¬\ncount for the fact that only a small fraction of this “master plan\"\nhas actually been put into practice.\nFor the next two or three weeks I must concentrate\non several business obligations that have accumulated during my re¬\ncent travels, but by late August I expect to have further time to\ndevote to the long-range planning we have discussed in our recent\nconversations. I hope that we (at RCA) shall be able to find ef¬\nfective channels for active cooperation with NAEB toward our cara¬\nmon objectives.\nJohn W.
