That is the method of allocating\navailable funds to the states to assure an equitable distribution\nof grants that moot realistic needs. As this bill is drawn,\nit would be possible for as few as eight of the 56 states and\nterritories entitled to funds to receive them during any fiscal\nyear. May 1 suggest that a formula be adopted which would\nallocate approximately half the funds available each year to\na large number of the states and territories which would qualify\nfor funds, and that the remaining funds be allocated in the\nform of larger grants to a smaller number of states or terri»»\ntories which plan major projects during that fiscal year."
