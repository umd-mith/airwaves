There was\nagreement among the members of the Committee that the most\nuseful approach to uncovering the needed information would\nbe to conduct a mail questionnaire survey of the individuals\nt\nwho had listed \"research\" as an area of competency in the\npersonnel survey conducted earlier by the NAEB.~*\nMore than 900 individuals listed \"research\" as a com¬\npetency in the NAEB personnel study. It was decided to sample\napproximately one-third of this total, but at the same time\nsend this list of the selected sample to each person in the\ninitial mailing. Space would be provided for respondents to\nlist anyone else engaged in radio-television research whose\nname did not appear on the list. Questionnaires would then\nbe sent to these additional individuals. This, combined with\nthe exhaustive efforts of the NAEB personnel study, would\nprovide the assurance that anyone involved in research in\neducational broadcasting would be contacted. This would also\nachieve one of the goals of the study, that of building a\nroster of people who are currently engaged in research projects.\nBronson and Fellows, op. cit."
