Therefore,\nthe amounts shown above are only 90% and 75% respectively of the amounts to be paid.\nSeminars.

It is felt that, even with the present income (of approximately\n$18,000) budgeted expenses could be reduced sufficiently to make the excess closer to\n$10,000 annually. An increase in the number of Individual members, possibly increased in¬\ncome from Industrial Associates and Sustaining members, plus a possible increase in dues\ncould provide a general NAEB income which would exceed budgeted expenses by $12,000.
