Another house of the village was set at a\nmatching angle to the Inn at camera left.\nThe costumes, as designed by Emmy Mellencamp, were a\ncompromise between the traditional children’s story-book\nillustrations and authentic Flemish costumes of the Nine¬\nteenth Century. Full costume notes for the stage production,\nwhich will be of assistance to any one designing costumes\nfor a television version, are to be found in the printed\nlibretto of the full musical setting published by the Willis\nMusic Company."
