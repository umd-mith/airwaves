I hope this seems workable to you and provides\nsufficient time for the NAEB business that should be conducted here in\nRegion VI.\nIncidentally, John Witherspoon in an earlier letter said, \"Since part of\nNAEB *s problem is that no one speaks for all of it at the regional level,\nperhaps you* 11 want the directors to name a person who can represent us\nby mutual consent.\" By any chance, was your reference to your increased\nrole at the regional level an answer to this problem? How best do I con¬\ntinue in making further provision for the sessions ? 1*11 appreciate your\nadvice.\nWe look forward to having you with us. Sorry I won't see you at Austin.\nJames M.
