Stolk, Chairman,\nCommittee for Economic Development\nbefore the\nNational Association of Business Economists\nSeptember 26, 1968\nMr. Reeder's generous introduction reminds me of\nthe wife who read the fortune-telling card her husband got\nfrom a penny weighing machine. \"You are a leader,\" she read,\n\"with a magnetic personality and strong character — intelligent,\nwitty and attractive to the opposite sex.\" Then she turned\nthe card over and added, \"it has your weight wrong, too.\"\nI welcome this opportunity to talk to you. Both the\nNational Association of Business Economists and CED are greatly\nconcerned with the American corporation's responsibility to\nhelp solve our country's serious social problems — urban\ndevelopment, civil rights, and education."
