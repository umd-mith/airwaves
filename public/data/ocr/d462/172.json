  "text": "~5~\nThink of the lives that this would change.\" He added that: \"Government funding\nis both right and essential , , . but , » . private sector responsibility, . ,\nis as great as that of the government.\"\nBy stressing two areas: 1) orienting formal education to the aural-visual\nneeds and psychological set of the child, rather than to the outmoded adminis¬\ntrative ease of the teacher; and 2) educating the majority society, I am not\nignoring other needs. We need much better use of the media to provide direct\ninformation and education to the residents of the ghetto, with materials that\nthey develop and that are developed to their needs and understanding; V7e need\nmuch more use of the media to enable the ghetto to communicate with itself,\nnot only communication into the ghetto, but communication within the ghetto;\nwe need greater use of the media for communication from the ghetto, to enable\nthe residents of the inner-city to \"tell it like it is\" to suburbia, to the\nrest of the world that thinks it knows, but by and large has been given only\nthe intellectual skimming of a situation and problems that have deep emotional\nroots.\nBut today, because of the relatively short time I have to speak with you,\nI want to enlarge, briefly, on just the two areas of formal education and\nmajority education.\nWe don’t have to rehash the problems of our educational system. Suffice\nto say that we have, by and large, one of the best educational systems of the\nnineteenth century. There are, however, some attempts being made to make it a\ngood system of the twentieth century-~the kind of system needed before we can\neffectively use communications in formal education to meet the needs of our\nurban crisis. I will mention only a few."
