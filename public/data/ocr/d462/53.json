We have reviewed the situation carefully —\nsee no barriers — and think that it might be a mutually\nprofitable effort. We would give nNight Call” the approp¬\nriate promotion. NAEB/NER would benefit by the visibility\nwe would attain through the broadcast. Shall we proceed\non the assumption that this will develop?\nI’ve been unable to develop any precise information re¬\ngarding ratemaking for educational broadcasting. The"
