Not\nmuch has been done in that direction.\nFor example, let us look at industry education and training. Are we\nproviding opportunities for the educated minority group membeis to work in\nexecutive positions commensurate with their education, or are we\nputting minority group members into the category of trained, as opposed to\neducated, personnel? Are we providing on the job education and training not\nonly for minority group people so that they can fit into all areas of our\norganisations, but perhaps more importantly education and training for the\nmajority group members of our organisations so that minority group members\nmay indeed have the opportunity to fit in?\nI stressed last year the need to completely reorient formal education\nand instruction as it is being largely practiced today. Today's child is\nnot the child of our youth. He is not living in a print-oriented society.\nEe is living in an aural and visual society. For example, by the time a\nchild has graduated from high school he has spent some 10,800 hours in the\nclassroom--and some 15,000 hours in front of the television set. Add to\nthat the countless number of hours a transistor radio is glued to his ear\nand you have some notion of what he is tuned in to.\nIt is no accident that last year the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights\nreported that not a single compensatory education program in the United States\nhas been successful. It is no accident that New York University's celebrated\nClinic for Learning in a junior high school in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant\nsection \"got the hell kicked out of us” and abandoned its efforts. It is no"
