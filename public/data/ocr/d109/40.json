How large is it to become (e.g.—wouldn’t a Washington Office help\ncreate a too large superstructure which will topple because it’s too\nmuch of a load for the NAEB (if Kellogg withdrew) to support?)\n3* How is it to be financed, eventually?\n4. Weren’t our publications proposals the sort of thing NPAC could\nhandle better?\n5. Had we discussed such projects (and possible\nmagazines, etc.) with them (and the association of educational\njournals) for combined projects?\nI got the impression that a crossing of organizational lines (HAE8 to get\ntogether with WPAC and others) and sharp definition (or redefinitions for\nexample Kellogg wouldn’t mind our eventually giving up the shipment and\ndubbing network (purely mechanical and manual) functions if it made sense) is in\norder before they will care to discuss specifics.\nA few other general impressionss Kellogg doesn’t care much for **supplemental”\nrequests. Why do we each year send in (or feel we should?) for more funds?\nKellogg is not very fond of ’’cafeteria-type* (i.e«, listing numerous possible\nprojects and requests) requests which they have to shop in and select from.\nHow about the ETRC? Did (or do) they pxabc prevent us from planning TV\nseries and distribution? In virtually all such instances Bob said he didn’t\nmean to be hard on jgg; fax that he knew I loonribcx wasn’t to blame, etc., but I\ngot the impression that we, and by name *the Board* “should get on the ball*\nbefore submitting further requests, in a vacuum, on a “cafeteria,* year-to-year\nbasis, and lay out a plan. We’re apparently now where we were a year ago, etc."
