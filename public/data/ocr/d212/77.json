If we want \"grass-roots’1 programs it\nseems to me that the \"grass-roots\" stations had better bear some respon\nsibility in offering programs® This, of course, doesn’t relieve Head¬\nquarters or the Network of the responsibility to beat the bushes for\nprograms 0\n6. Agreement—the value of the Tape Network is that stations can\nbroadcast when program would be of maximum value in local situation,\nbut cost and work of a delayed broadcast should be up to individual\nstation, because in getting away from simultaneity we are likely to go\ntoo far in opposite direction, which kills much of timeliness value of\nradio. I’m dead set against any fixed catalogue—library type or opera\ntion because of its two great dangers: (a) it violates a fundamental\ncharacteristic of the medium of flexibility, timeliness—it just isn’t\nRADIO. (b) the costs go up as the \"mass\" handling of programs goes\ndown—also, the library is soon full of deadwood. How are changes for\nsuch service going to be made, and how figure the income to meet our\nincreasing Kellogg obligations? As for the availability of past series\nthe Network keeps copies that could be duplicated to meet a small de¬\nmand of this type.\n7. No comment.\n8. Agreement.\n9. The answer here is NOl if you mean what I think you do.\nSeveral small regional operations will end up costing more than one"
