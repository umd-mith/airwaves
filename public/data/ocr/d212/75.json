Subject: Network & NAEB\nI hope John Dunn won't mind if I adopt his form in order to join\nthe fracas now in progress concerning the Network in particular and\nNAEB in general0 Parenthei/tically, I'm glad to see this whole commo¬\ntion as I believe it is a sign of the fermentation indicative of NAEB: l\ngrowth and coming-of-age.\nHere are some comments on John’s blast—both pro and con:\nTo begin with, I don’t believe that the Network is being run to\nthe satisfaction or for the benefit of any individual or group of in¬\ndividuals. The point to remember about the Network is that its growth\nhas been weed-like and in its short life it nearly wrecked one station\n(WNYC) in giving it birth, its paternity was changed before it could\nwalk, and now it is expected to perform like an adult at age 2 when it\nstill lacks a heart (the mass duplicator)£ Not to belabor to above im¬\nage, I think that the Network will have to do without its adolescence,\nbut let’s be realistic: a wire net won’t operate without wires, and\ntape net won’t operate with maximum flexibility without a mass dupli¬\ncator; This is not a defense of Network faults, but a statement of\nfacts. The present package system is but a stop gap measure which\noffers the greatest flexibility under present circumstances. It was\nnever envisioned as the final method of distribution. This final\nmethod has been spelled out repeatedly. Criticism should be directed\ntoward this method, not the package method—it’s a waste of time to\nkill a dying man!\nNow to John’s numbered paragraphs—\n1. I am in general agreement as to the importance of the Network\nand its relation to NAEB. It _is one of the principal things the Associ ¬\nation has to offer, but I think we can get so close to the importance\nof the Network that we will not see that the NAEB can and must offer"
