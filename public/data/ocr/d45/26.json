This is a\nreal treat after months in bed. However, X am still very weak and it is always a\nrelief to get back in bed after an ”up session. I touched bottom and will have\nto take things easy for some time, but the doctors tell me that I am doing well,\nand may be back in the office within 30 to 60 days. Here's hoping\nRecently I have had scm of my mil brought out from the office, occassionally\nI try to peck cut a reply here and there during my \"sitting^up\" period. I just\ncame across your memo of January 11 relative to FAE's history of adult education«\nI am attaching a brief of our experience, and I hope I am not too late to be of\nsome assistance to Mr. Grattan. This is very brief, but if moro is wanted please\nlet me know.\nWTHS-TV is still hanging fire. I have the facilities, but the opposition has\nmanaged to stymy us with the cry of wno tax monies for TV,\" and with me out for\nfour months I just don't know. Maybe if I HAD kicked the bucket I would have been\nmartyr enough to inspire some action, but this way I am just weak and no little\ndiscouragedplease remember to all the gang, and thank everyone for\nthat lovely card you all sent from /hoes, it gave me a wonderful lift at just the\ntime. With all good personal wishes,\nNABB HEADQUARTERS - 3/3/54*\nSincerely\n/&/ V^jrnon Bronson"
