C.\nDear Harold:\nThank you for your letter advising that the entire Region\nII is illegitimate -- in action taken at the Williamsburg Conference\nto set up something of an \"Executive Committee\".\nFirst, this is a recommendation for which I -- not John\nYoung or anyone else -- was responsible. John simply presented\nmy recommendation.\nSecondly, I did not have in mind an organizational set-up\nof the formal nature for which the NAEB Constitution and By-Laws\nprovide -- though, of course, there's no reason why it should not\nbe made formal and in full accord with NAEB Constitutional law.\nWhile my wife's serious illness is quite extended, you may\nbe sure that I will, at the earliest appropriate time, gather with\nall Region II officials involved and move to comply in every respect\nwith the type of organization called for, and by bulletin notify\nall Region II members that we are indeed \"legit\". We will also\nconfirm site and Conference Chairman for 1966.\nI look forward with pleasure as always to seeing you and\nBill and all colleagues in Columbus May 31, if not sooner.\nThank you, and best personal regards always\nSincerely,\nJE/mcl\ncc: Mr\nMr\nMr\nJohn Young, Mrs. Marjorie Newman, Mr. Hugh DeSamper,\nRoy Johnston, Mr. Jim Petersen, Mr. William Harley,\nHolt Riddleberger, Mr. Howard Holst, Mr. William Galbreath"
