It\nis my understanding from Jerry Appy that he is sending you a\nreport on the TV sessions separately.\nIt seemed to me (and I am sending a copy of this letter to Ken Wright\nwith the request that he communicate directly with you if he has any\ncorrections or additions) - it seemed to me that the following were\nthe high points of our day of discussions:\n1. Mr. Andreas Pot, touring educational radio stations in\nthis country for Radio Nederlands, sat with us throughout\na long day of talk and, when pressed, was good enough to\nmake some excellent observations from a perspective none\nof us can easily attain. It was his comment that we are\noverly pessimistic about the quality of what we do and its\nworth. He also suggested that a great void we could well\nfill is in news and commentary since it was his view that\nworld news is insufficiently covered in our commercial press.\n2. We solved no major problems but we discussed them all at\nvarying lengths - directions, purpose, etc. Some time was\ndevoted to specific problems of station representatives in\nattendance and I think in that area some value may have been\nrealized by those with questions.\n3. A good deal of discussion was given to the proposed Madison\nseminar. A vote showed that eight of the approximately\nfifteen station representatives there were at least 50% certain\nof attending such a meeting in Madison in July or August. The\nsuggestion was made that perhaps it would be better to arrange\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY BROADCASTING SERVICE"
