In feet, if your whole staff\nbecome individual members, you’ll probably all always know.\nVie shall count on you. Attached, just hot out of an envelope\nfrom Hurlbert, the most advanced warning I can give of upcoming\nRegional meeting. I’m telling him I*m free at that time — and\nrather think that will be the date. (Just checked with Harley.\nOK with him too.)\nHave you any good pictures on file, of station operations (of\nNAEB members) that you could send Raymond Hurlbert? Ve’re getting\nout a little brochure for individual membership drive. How is a\ngood time for all good men to cone to the aid of the cause.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director\nBJS/dp\ncot Raymond Hurlbert.\nWilliam Harley/^\nEnel"
