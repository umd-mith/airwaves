There are too many Weeks, Bays, Months listed\nin the Chamber of Commerce calendars.\n9) A drive for NAKB members among teachers is\nyour very best idea. Create committees in each area\nimmediately to do this. Hold parties in each community\nfor new members. This is what should be publicized.\n10^ Before you set your goal of how many national\narticles per year, to be given to the slicks, get the\nfirst article into print.\n11) Organize an electronic meeting, publicize this\nin the major trade publications. This will he a starting\npoint for your articles.\n12) Organizing an ETV and KR unit to interchange\nideas is not going to get you an ounce of publicity.\n13) First job - a brand new up-to-date Fact\nSheet. Second job - listing of publications. Third\njob - sending Fact Sheet with covering letters to\neditors, asking them to let you know what further infor¬\nmation they would like.\nBest regards,\nBernie Kamins\nBK/le"
