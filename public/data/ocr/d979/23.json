  "text": "-2-\nstate legislature, since we have no metropolitan communities large enough\nto act independently. A detailed account of all the plans and proposals\nconsidered in the legislative sessions of 1953 and 1955, which is out of\nplace here, would show that Connecticut is deeply interested in making\nuse as soon as possible of its three reserved channels. Any action by the\nCommission which would deprive the state of the use of these channels in\nthe future would be looked upon as a severe and unnecessary loss to the\nCause of education and public welfare.\n5. Any proposal at this time which involves interference with the\neducational reservations can, we believe, be traced directly to the well-\nknown opposition which the organized television industry has shown from\nthe beginning. In its Sixth Report and Order the Commission overruled the\nindustry’s arguments and made the reservations. So far as we are aware,\nno industry spokesman has gone so far as to attribute to the educational\nreservations any share in the difficulties which have arisen to delay the\nattainment of the Commission’s objectives. Fortunately, the hostile at¬\ntitude of certain segments of the industry toward the educational reser¬\nvations is not generally shared by local commercial television stations,\nas shown by the fact that in many communities they have generously as¬\nsisted the educational stations by contributions of equipment, housing,\ntechnical service, and financial aid for both construction and operation.\n6. Although the above comments are based on various informal propos¬\nals which have been aired in recent months, the Council believes that they\nwill be fully applicable to any and all formal proposals submitted in re¬\nsponse to the Commission's invitation.\nRespectfully submitted,\nCONNECTICUT CITIZENS COUNCIL\nFOR EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION\nByt Charies C. Williamson, Acting Chairihan,\n20 Church Stl, Greenwich, Connecticut\nDecember 13, 1955*"
