Interdisciplinary presentations would reach\nmore students than they do now, one section at a time. It is\nneeded now to afford flexibility and adaptibility to our teacher\ntraining program.\"\nDonovan Moffett, President\nCortland College of Education\nState University of New York\n\"I foresee the possibility of a channel fully utilized by eastern\nMontana college programs in five years with a further channel\nneeded for interchange of instruction, or diversification of\nofferings. I strongly recommend the reservation of two channels\nfor higher education in Billings, Montana.\"\nHurbert L. Steele, President\nEastern Montana College of\nEducation\n\"We expect to have a considerable increase in enrollment during\nthe next ten years. Just how we shall be able to take care of\nthis increase in enrollment has not yet been determined. Per¬\nhaps the answer will come from the use of broadcast television.\"\nH. Bussell Beatty, President\nWentworth Institute\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\"Presently we need to do something about reducing our faculty\nload, since our student-faculty ratio is over 20 to 1. We are\nalso badly in need of science laboratories and considerably ex¬\npanded classroom space to take care of our rapidly increasing\nenrollment. Part of the care of this increased size of student\nbody should certainly be brought about by the use of broadcast\ntelevision and closed-circuit television.\"\nHarold E. Hide\nPlymouth Teachers College\nPlymouth, New Hampshire"
