(You should.)\n• Do you inform your institutional staff of special future pro¬\ngrams ?\n• Does your budget permit the use of window posters, tire\ncovers, or license plates calling attention to your station?\n• Do you feed to the news bureau at your institution stories\non new programs, new production gimmicks, and other\nangles that are legitimately news worthy? Also pictures?\n• Do you keep in mind what makes news? (Such things as\nstaff speeches to civic groups . . . added power . . . new\nequipment . . . behind-the-scenes human interest stories . . .\nanniversaries of the station . . . tie-ins with community\ndrives, such as the United Fund and Heart Association . . .\ncrystal-ball opinions of staff members on the future of\nbroadcasting . . . gifts, grants, bequests . . .)\n• Do you dream up and produce one-time special events that\nare audience builders in themselves?\n• And do you watch out for names — individual and group —\nthat will appear within remoting distance of your station?\n• Do you get exclusives on big events? (It’s nice when you\nknow that people have to listen to your station.)\nYou can give yourself a discount here, if it’s\non items where finances are squeezing you.\nWas it Shakespeare who reminded us that the axle squeaking the loudest\ngets the grease?"
