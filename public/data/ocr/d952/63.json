Knowing nothing about the\nsituation, he wrote on a personal basis, and said I might use pertinent\ndope, but asked me not to circulate the letter as such. Here goes....\nHe is still chairman of the Radio-TV department at Indiana University....\ndata regarding him are on file with the Bureau of Placement, University\nof Michigan....Walter Roberts in charge of Austrian Public Affairs,\nNew State Building, Department of State, Washington, can provide a\nstatement on Skomia work in Austria.. *> ©The President, Dean and others\nat I.
