  "text": "Since the FM-10A utilizes identical circuitry to that used in\nhigher power commercial transmitters, students can derive technical as\nwell as program experience from its operation,\nDESCRIPTION\nElectrical\nThe FM-10A is a crystal controlled phase modulated transmitter.\nFrequency stability of .001$ is assured by utilizing thermostatically\ncontrolled crystal heaters. The broad audio frequency response is ach¬\nieved by utilizing conventional pulse shaping and phase modulating cir¬\ncuits. The RF frequency multipliers are driven into saturation, thus\nreducing AM hum to a negligible value.\nIt should be noted that no RF stage acts as an on frequency ampli¬\nfier. This eliminates the problem of neutralization and assures freedom\nfrom parasitics and continuity of programming.\nAll circuits of the FM-10A can be tuned from the front panel.\nThis ease of tuning plus the availablity of meters for every RF circuit\npermits ease of operation, maintenance and technical analysis. A power\noutput meter on the meter turret gives a direct reading of transmitter\noutput.\nFacilities for switching two audio inputs are available. Their\nlevels are adjusted by a front panel attenuator to achieve the desired *<■\nvalue on the \"modulation meter\".\nMechanical\nThe FM-10A Is housed in an attractive custom cabinet and incorpor¬\nates a modern styled control turret. It requires a floor space of\n22 7/8 x 23 1/16\".\nThe transmitter Is completely self contained and requires only the\ninstallation of tubes, crystal and the connection of audio and power\nlines before operation can begin."
