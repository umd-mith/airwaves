This transmitter combined\nwith an antenna gain of two can adequately serve a small city.\nThe FM-250A may also be used as a driver for a 3KW or 5KW ampli¬\nfier.\nDESCRIPTION\nElectrical\nThe FM-250A is a crystal controlled phase modulated transmitter.\nIts block diagram is presented below. Frequency stability of .001$ is\nassured by utilizing a thermostatically controlled heated crystal. Mo¬\ndulation is obtained by utilizing conventional pulse networks and vary¬\ning the phase at these pulses at an audio rate."
