  "text": "FOREWORD\nThis new directory has been prepared after a complete survey of the institutional\nmembership of the NAEB in an effort to obtain accurate and up-to-date informa¬\ntion. In a few cases station powers are not listed because the stations, in return¬\ning the questionnaire, listed ERP rather than rated transmitter power. When a\nsecond questionnaire failed to produce this information, it was omitted.\nAlthough a new Directory will not be printed until summer, 1958, changes will be\nlisted in the Newsletter each month for your information so that you may keep\nyour copy up to date. Space has been left at the end of the each state section for\nthe addition of the new members. YOUR COOPERATION IN HELPING US\nKEEP THE DIRECTORY UP TO DATE WILL BE APPRECIATED.\nPLEASE SEND IN ANY CHANGES AS SOON AS THEY OCCUR.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSummary of Membership & Analysis of Active Membership. 1\nOfficers, Directors, Consultants, Staff and Honorary Members .. 2\nStates in NAEB Regions . 3\nActive Members . 4\nAssociate Members .20\nAffiliate Members .30\nAlphabetical Listing of Radio Stations (By Call Letters) .37\nAlphabetical Listing of TV Stations (By Call Letters) .38\nNOTE: (*) An asterisk following the call letters indicates that the station\nsubscribes to the NAEB Radio Network Service."
