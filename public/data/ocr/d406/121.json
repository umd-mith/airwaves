The\nresponsibility and authority of these institutions varies widely. Some are sources of\nfunds, some have administrative authority, some are licensees, and some are\nlegislative or gubernatorial commissions established to study the possibilities of\ndeveloping a role for the state to play.\nThis listing identifies the entity in each state which most clearly has the major\nresponsibility for state activity in this field. Where more than one entity has an\nimportant role, additional entries have been included.\nALABAMA\nDenis N.
