  "text": "Problem - Should we publish a monthly 32-page magazine, with advertising,\ninstead of the present NAEB Newsletter?\nReason - Through ad sales, the hope would be to make enough money to support the\nmagazine and a quarterly Journal,\nPoints to Consider -\n1* Do v® have enough readers to warrant selling ads? At a high enough rate\nto make a profit? Is there a need for another magazine in the field?\n2* Do we have enough to say to fill both a montbfer magazine and a quarterly\njournal? Will people road both? Will w© downgrade the journal by moving\narticles to the magazine? Or will it become so scholarly as to be read\nby only a handful of people?\n3. Printing costs * About §20 per page, for 1,500 copies plus cover, for an\n8£ x 11 magazine, black ink only, with colored cover* Approximate costs:\n32 pages, #7255 16 pages, #405.\n(Present Newsletter averages about #100 per month for 1,500 copies} pre¬\nsent Journal, about #1,000 per issue for 2,100 copies*)\n4* Personnel. Would need, in addition to someone to handle all advertising,\n1 full-time editorial assistant, plus additional typing and proofreading\nhelp*\nRecommendations -\nFIRST, find out whether wo can sell ads. Get an ad salesman or hire some firm\nto find out* Have him find out also whether ads might sell in the Journal*\nunder its present format*\nTHEN, based on the findings, either:\n1* Continue the present publications (selling ads in the Journal)\nor\n2* Issue a monthly magazine, with ads, and do away with the Journal entirely.\nUntil the membership and subscription lists grow oonsideriB^FT^ do not\nbelieve we should try to issue two such publications."
