Schooley\nUniversity of Illinois Broadcasting\n228 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Frank:\nThank you for your notice of the meeting of the NAEB Publications\nCommittee at 8 A.M. Monday morning.\n--—- I wonder if it would be appropriate, Frank, for us to have on the\nagenda a discussion of the book review section of the NAEBfs Educational\nBroadcasting, or whatever the hell it is we are now calling this publi¬\ncation. I am sure there are other matters, too, such as the format of\nthe publication which has already been considered, and which I would like\nto see taken up again now that some time has gone by since the last meeting\nin which formating was considered.\nWill you have some way in which we can get in touch with you and\nfind out precisely where at the Marriott the meetings will take place?\nKindest regards. Look forward to seeing you on the morning of\nthe 23rd.\nBernarr Cooper\nAssociate Professor\nBC:ew"
