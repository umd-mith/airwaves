Under this arrangement, the Quarterly\ndoes not carry news of Kappa Tau Alpha; the idea behind it is to\nacquaint students with a leading professional organ in their fields\nA second way of developing bulk sales would be to encourage\nteachers of radio-TV courses to order copies enough for students\nin their classes and to use the journal for supplementary reading,,\n2o Control of Complimentary Copies,, Over a year, the magazine\ncould save money by properly controlling distribution of complimentary\ncopies a The editorial board should write a statement of policy\nregarding free copies, and the editor-in-chief should be responsible\nfor strict adherence to this policy, We recommend that each\ncontributor be given four copies of the issue in which his article\nappears. Should he desire additional copies of his article, he\nshould either (a) order reprints or (b) order extra copies of the\nIssue in advance at the standard rate<> We also recommend that\ncomplimentary subscriptions be held to a bare minimum,\n3. Promotion,, Association headquarters should prepare a\nseries of letters to (a) obtain renewals and (b) develop new\ncirculation,. The renewal effort should be made as consistently\nand methodically as that of any commercial magazine. That Is,\nthe subscription list should be reviewed each month, and the proper\nmailing piece sent out; the first in the series of renewal letters\nshould be mailed at least one month before expiration of membez^shlpo"
