It would\nbe helpful if we8 d analyse what9 s appeared in the JOURNAL*\nProm the study or survey ne might corns up with some findings\nthat would enable all of us to improve the publication, or the\nNAEB publications.\nFor example, if the JOURNAL is to be scholarly,\nshould it carry certain types of articles ? Should some go\ninto the NEWSLETTER? Or, should there be-a s,popular science”\ntype of publication which would carry more of the popularised\nstories on radio and television education, and the many how-to-\ndo-it articles?\nSo, would you help by checking on the attached sheets\nyour evaluations of the articles that have appeared. Please\nreturn to me sometime this month. 1311 compile the data and pass\nalong to you, and to the next cosaalttee, and to the staff.\nSeason's greetings from a guy who doesn31 like\nquestionnaires.\nChairman\nPublications Committee, NAEB\nFESfb\nEnel."
