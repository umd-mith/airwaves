  "text": "TO:\nFROM:\nHerewith are copies of suggested releases for each of the programs\nwhich constitute the seven one-hour long programs of the \"People\nUnder Communism\" series. These releases maybe re-written\ncompletely, if you so desire.\nThe best way to make use of these is to mimeograph or duplicate\neach release - after filling in your station call-letters - and the\ntime, day and date that the program is to go on the air. These\nshould then be mailed to all the radio and newspaper editors in\nyour area at least ten days to two weeks before air time.\nYou might use extra copies and send them directly to some of the\nimportant people in your institution and your community.\nPlease note that the use of the term \"Release #1\", etc. , should\nnot appear on your own copy.\nAdditional releases concerning the thirteen half-hour lectures, and\nthe special half-hour documentary \"Through the Iron Curtain\" will\nbe forthcoming.\nWe would be delighted to hear from you as to how you are making\nuse of the audience building aid.\nsns /t.\nend . 7"
