C.\nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nMEMORANDUM\nJanuary 24, 1962\nTO 2 MEMBERS OP THE AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION\nFROMs LOGAN WILSON\nThe House Rules Committee has today voted out HR 8900,\nwhich means that the way is now open for Congressional action\nearly next week on legislation to provide loans and grants for\nFederal assistance in the construction of classrooms,\nlaboratories and libraries in public and private colleges and\nuniversities. The Senate will probably take up legislation\nfor academic facilities (S 1241) in the same week.\nThe issue will be decided favorably, we believe, only if\nthe Representatives and Senators are convinced by messages\nfrom their home states that this legislation should be passed.\nYou will find attached a joint statement from higher\neducation organizations in support of HR 8900 which was issued\nat a press conference Tuesday, January 23, If you are in\nposition to help, we hope the statement will be useful in\ntaking such steps--by telephone, telegram, or letter—as you\nmay deem appropriate.\nClearly this is the time for leaders in higher education\nto make their views known to their Senators and Representatives0\nRECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nJAN 2 6 1962\nAM\n7|8|9|ip|ll|12|l|2|8|4|5|?"
