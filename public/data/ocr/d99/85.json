A Laby whale\nslowly crosses the screen...\nf olioweci by the mother whale..\nAs the whale's head gets\nalmost across the screen,\nit winks its eye.\nTEACHER: Even then, you know,\nfish farming wouldn't be easy.\nHow can we get our fish-crops to\n\"stay put\" and grow...instead of\nswimming away? The answer, I\nunderstand from those who are\nexperimenting in the field, is to\nfence them in. ..using what is known\nabout how fish react to color,\nnoise, and disturbed water.\nTEACHER: If this doesn’t work,\nI'll probably have to give up\naquaculture. Of course, I might\ntake up whale ranching.\nTEACHER: (VO) Obey say that\ncould be very profitable in the\nfuture. Because in addition to\neverything else she has of value,\nthe mother whale gives a ton of\nmilk a day!\nMkybe she'd even teach me to\nbreauhe under water.
