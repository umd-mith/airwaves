Let’s file on behalf of NAEB favoring the low\npowered television stations.\n2. Let’s watch the daytime sky wave preceding so that\nwhatever is done is not to the detriment of any NASB members.\nIf and when we must take position to hold the front, let’s\nfile.\n3„ Our position on subscription television is that\nwe sit by quietly.\n4. I am glad to know that things look reasonably\ngood in the tape-postage proposal.\n5. I will get you our reaction at the proper time (I\nhope) on the petition of the National Association of Manufacturers.\n6. I am forwarding your statement to Treasurer\nBob Coleman for payment as per our discussion.\nKind personal regards.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident\nFES:js\ncc: Harry J. Skornia"
