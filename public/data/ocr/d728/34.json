  "text": "Extract from Headquarters® Memo, dated February 13, 1952\nAVAILABLE CHOICE AND COSTS\nThe Network normally will offer eight packages of programs per\nyear* Even after individual distribution becomes possible some similar\noffering period will prevail. These ei^it packages constitute the normal\nservices obtained by payment of the annual service assessment fee. It\nis not practical to materially increase this service without increasing\nthe costs. Therefore, the in-school programs are not being offered in\naddition to the regular service but in lieu of a portion of it.\nTwo packages of in-school programs will be offered each year.\nThis makes a total of ten packages. A station may select a maximum of\neight packages for any one year. If a station desires all ten packages\nit will have to pay an additional fee to cover costs of recording,\nhandling, etc.\nOne possibility being submitted to the Board is that the extra\ntwo packages will cost a station one-fourth of its annual assessment.\nThis, it see ns probable, would be the maximum cost. CAUTION jixThis, I\nrepeat is not final. The only thing certain at this time is, that if a\nstation desires all programs, it will have to pay a small extra fee.\nOn the other hold, a school station can get six regular pack¬\nages, enough to cover the school year—September through May—and both\nschool packages at no increase over its regular assessment fee."
