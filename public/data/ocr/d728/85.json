  "text": "Explanation. If the first research project may be\nthou$it of as a study of the ’’grand designv of educational radio in\nan institution and community, project 2 is an approach to a study\nof the grand design of educational radio in the United States. It\nsimultaneously serves the purpose of (1) providing an objective re¬\nview of the Tape Network operation which can be used for evaluation\npurposes for the Kellogg Foundation; (2) providing the administrators\nof the Network with practical operating assistance; and (3) supple¬\nmenting the results of project 1 with collateral information on the\ninter-institutional aspects of the local rgrand design.”\nPersonnel recommendation. I would suggest that\nProfessor Keith Tyler and a young research man be selected for\nproject no* 2. If he is available, Mr. Merritt Ludwig, now respon¬\nsible for research on the WO I-TV experimental programs, would be\nwell qualified.\nYour prompt comments on these proposals is invited, in\norder that some consensus may be submitted to the Board in the very\nnear future.\nCopies to NAEB officers\nBoard members\nDallas W. Smythe\nDirector of Studies"
