It is currently on the tape network and\nhas been accepted by fifty stations®\nHe has secured for us the rights to the Little Orchestra public dress rehearsal\nbroadcast, and we will offer these programs in the spring©\nHe has agreed to come to the NAEB Convention at Minneapolis, and I have agreed to\ncover his expenses to that convention© Burton has him scheduled to appear Saturday\nmoning, November 8, on one of the general sessions©\nThis is the entire story© I heartily recommend that you approve this proposal©\nThere is sufficient money in the tape netiaork budget to handle it, and I do not\nbelieve it will be setting a precedent which we do, not care to follow. I would\nlike to further re co rune nd that this be made a matter for the agenda at the\nMinneapolis board meeting©"
