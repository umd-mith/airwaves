Even\nnow we cannot give you a definite answer. However, if satisfactory arrange¬\nments can be made regarding the assessments to be imposed January 1, 1952\nwe will gladly continue our participation in the NAEB Network functions.\nTo come directly to the point, we are a part time station broad¬\ncasting a total of six hours a week (Monday Evenings 6:00 to 12:00 P. M.).\nAs a result we can use only a small portion of the program material of¬\nfered by the network. ” On this basis our hourly cost per programs is con¬\nsiderably higher than similar class stations.\nWe feel this situation merits some consideration on your part\nand that a fair assessment for our station would be in the neighborhood\nof one-sixth the amount charged to a full time station.\nWould you please advise us of your views on the matter.\nSincerely,\n/s/ C. J. Kuna\nC. J. Kuna\nCJKtmmk"
