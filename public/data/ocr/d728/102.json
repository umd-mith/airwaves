The Board of Directors will be meeting in Columbus one day\nprior to the opening of Keith Tyler’s Institute* It is my\nhope that we can do all NAEB business on Tuesday„ April 12„\nso that the officers can attend the Institute. Therefore,\n2<> Will each Committee Chairman please prepare a report on the\nwork of his committee as of April 1, and mail it no later than\nApril 1 to Headquarters so that it may be duplicated for\nBoard members*\na. Please limit it to one page*\nb. Report may include report on what’s been done9 what’s\nbeing done, and what’s undone*\nc. If the Committee is still vague as to what is expected\nof it, if it thinks it could do some things better,\nothers less efficiently, then this report would be\nappropriate place to indicate possible direction*\n3* It is hoped that these reports may be combined and distributed\nto the members*\n4* If you have any proposal on which Board action is deemed^\nadvisable, please submit it separately no later than April 1*\nThe proposal should be in form so that the Board may give it\ncareful and adequate consideration, but expeditiously too*\n5o The NAEB Luncheon will be Thursday noon, April 14«\n6* A personal note* You don’t need to wait for formal requests\nfor formal reports. I always welcome voices of advice from\nyou, and in fact, many of you have been most helpful to me\nwith your advice* Thanks*\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nMarch 10, 1955"
