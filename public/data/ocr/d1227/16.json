These committees screen and select the programs\nthat are carried by the Network and discuss new program possibilities.\n\"Now we are planning for the future. Our relations with the various founda¬\ntions, especially the W, K. Kellogg Foundation which made the original grant which\nmade possible the establishment of the Headquarters and Network, and the Fund for\nAdult Education which has made possible our Engineering, Placement, Management\nRelations, and Consultation Team services as well as our professional advancement\nprogram, are excellent. These grants have enabled some of the dreams of educa¬\ntional broadcasters to become realities. Our future plans envision expanded serv¬\nices, continued cooperation with \"sister\" organizations and some sort of Washington\nrepresentation. None of these can become realities without the active and enthu¬\nsiastic support and cooperation of all members. And we welcome, in fact need, your\nsuggestions and criticisms at all times.\"\nChairman Smith called for questions to be directed to Dr. Skornia. The follow¬\ning questions and answers are representative:\nQuestion: Are there any particular mechanics one must go through for a request\nfor an NAEB grant?\nAnswer: There is a form of letter for requesting a grant that is sent to the\nacceptance committee.\nQuestion: What would be the purpose of the Washington office?"
