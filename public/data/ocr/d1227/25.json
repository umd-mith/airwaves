Affiliate members have no vote but may attend\nmeetings and get some of the materials, although we cannot promise to send them\neverything. Associate status, which I think some of you would qualify for, is\navailable to those educational institutions which broadcast over facilities\noperated by others, whether radio or TV, educational or commercial.\nINFORMAL SESSIONS\nFriday Luncheon Meeting\nDr. Constance Warren, former President, Sarah Lawrence College, served as\nchairman of this meeting, featuring a talk by Mr. M. S. Novik. In her introduction\nDr. Warren said:\n\"Mr. Novik has hitched himself to some of the most interesting people. I\nprefer to sit beside him and ask him questions as he wants you all to do. He at\none time managed Clarence Darrow and Bertrand Russell, both intriguing in their own\nway; he was right-hand-man to Mayor La Guardia and since that time has managed\nWNYC and worked through that to the people of New York. He has been labor consul¬\ntant for various organizations and is now Management Relations consultant for\nthe NAEB.\"\nMr. Novik then spoke on \"A Suggested Philosophy of Educational Television Re¬\nlationships with the Community.\" Mr. Novik*s speech was ad lib, and unfortunately\nno record was made of his remarks. The meeting was then opened to questions.\nSkornia: How are you going to reconcile and keep out the many proprietary\npressures on you as manager of a community station?\nNovik: If you have a chance at the beginning tell the guy who’s hiring you\nand then iron out this first. If not and you’re stuck, just try to get the best"
