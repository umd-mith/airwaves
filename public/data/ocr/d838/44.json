Bull\nDirector of Radio\nIowa State College\nAmes, Iowa\nDear Richards\nI imgin® you know of Docket So. 9470, the petition of th© Radio\nCommission of the Southern Baptist Convention, for a group of\nlow-power F& station® in th* 88 megacycle band. If this petition\nis granted, it will mean that th© educational band will be broken,\nend it can well moan th® elimination of th© special fretgueaoies\nassigned to education.\nThe Protestant Radio Coasals.fioa is filing a brief with the Federal\nCoEsaunications Ccum!salon, strongly opposing the granting of\nlicenses to non-educational groups in th© 88-92 a. bend. I have\nnot been able to find that any educational organisation faae oaae\nforward to oppose the applications of the Southern Baptist Conven¬\ntion. It seems to me all persons interested in educational broad¬\ncasting should make representations to the Federal Coam&mications\nCommission concerning these applications. I know It is a bother,\nbut those of us who believe in this business must take the time to\nfight for it.\nDo you or your organisation intend to take any action regarding\nthis application? I will appreciate it if you rill let me know\nwhat stands you propose to taka.\nSincerely yours.\n(Signed) Everett\nEverett C. Parker\nDirector"
