There\nmay be others.\n1* Transmitter Power: Station* with limited power\nprovide limited service. The case is best stated by\nquoting from Report No. 7834 dated January 23, 1969\nand released by the Federal Communications Commission in\ndenying the rulemaking petition for increase of trans¬\nmitter power for educational Class D FM stations. The\nreport says, in part:\n\"Rules providing for licensing of low-powered non-commer¬\ncial educational FM stations, the Commission noted, were\nadopted on August 19, 1948 (FCC 48-1958 Docket 0948).\nThe stations were not intended as alternates to regular\neducational FM broadcast stations but were considered\nsubstitut4s for wired carrier \"campus'* systems using AM\nbroadcast channels ...\"\n\"The service ... was intended to be limited to a small\narea, usually a college or university campus or the im¬\nmediately surrounding area.\"\n\"The simplicity of the present provision has served\nthe intended purpose of the rule ...”\n\"When better coverage is desired, regular non-commercial\neducational FM broadcast stations may be used to provide\na stibbfe&attal improvement (in power and coverage).\"\nIt would seem that the guidelines are rather precisely\nestablished and that transmitter power is an appropriate\ncriterion for identifying public radio stations.\n2. Coverage. Unless the station is providing coverage\nto substantial numbers of people, its public function is\nobviously limited. There is obvious corollary between\ntransmitter power and coverage but both should be con¬\nsidered. For example, in certain isolated rural areas,\na 10 watt FM station may provide the only coverage (and\nthus the only service) available from a non-commercial\nstation. The question might be: Is the station serving"
