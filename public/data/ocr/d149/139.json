It is our\nunderstanding that Mr. Holt in his radio study for the\nFord Foundation and the CPB is looking into the Washington\nsituation as well as those in Los Angeles, Chicago, and\nDetroit. His guidance and data will be helpful.\nIt has been suggested that, in addition to these\nlarge cities it might be useful to test this model system\nfor audience reaction in a less urban or rural area. The\nauthor believes that The Wisconsin State Network might\nprovide such a test point for the system. If Wisconsin\nwere interested it would also test a full range of audience\nresponse among different population groupings due to\nthe state-wide coverage by that network. Their facilities\nand operating performance are excellent, as Mr. Holt’s\nstudy attests.\nVI Cost of the System\nThe cost of an initial National Public Radio System\nwould consist primarily of:\n(a) Headquarters facilities\n(b) Interconnection Circuits\n(c) Tape distribution to Basic Stations\n(d) Program and Production Costs including\ntalent fees, permanent program and production personnel,\nand related production expenses.\n(e) Length of the experimental model (Note:\nMr. Frank Gillard of the BBC suggests strongly the need\n\"to have a long run, of three or four years perhaps,\nbefore evaluation . . .It takes time to wean people away\nfrom existing and.long-established listening habits and\nto get them to reorient themselves on a completely new\nservice*')"
