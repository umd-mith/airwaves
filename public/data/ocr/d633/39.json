My present plans do not call\nfor me to attend the NAEB National Convention at Omaha.\nAs you may have heard. Arm and Hunter is just recovering from an oper¬\nation and it is just possible he may ask me to attend in his place.\nWith the research funds of the ETRC being somewhat restricted this looks\nlike an ideal time for the NAEB to launch an expanded program of research\nactivities. Quite among ourselves, I am disturbed that we have not moved\nmore rapidly in capitalizing on the momentum we gained as a result of the\nNAEB research seminar. If something does not happen pretty soon we will\nhave a historical document instead of a working paper.\nThere has still been no action on the part of the Association anent your\nrecommendation of a central repository for research materials. An\ninvitation to provide same has been extended by Michigan State over a\nyear ago. This invitation still stands.\nIt is a muggy day in East Lansing and I fear I sound more pessimistic than\nI really am, but I think this is the type of suggestion you were asking for.\nHave a good time in New York.\nSincerely,\nDirector of Television Research\nIRM/cdm\ncc: Harry Skornia"
