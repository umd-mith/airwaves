Becker\n464 Silversifle Drive\nNew York 27, New York\nDear Sam:\nI was delighted to receive your letter, forwarded to me from\nFlorida State University.\nI must honestly admit that I didn't know you were in New York.\nApparently in the rush of things I didn't see the notice on\nyour most recent move.\nYes, I'll be in Omaha, even though it wipes out my poor little\ntravel budget for the year. But I'm certainly sorry to learn\nthat you won't be with us although perhaps you can make a last\nminute change and come in for a few hours.\nThe Gran$s-in-Aid announcement just came in and I'm looking\nforward to seeing what we get this year. Some of the things\nin the past were a bit weak....\nIn your letter you asked about specific times during which the\ncommittee could meet. --I'm available at any hour, although save\nme enough time to get at least one good steak. (This Florida\nbeef is mighty tough. The toughest bull from the west would\ntaste tender compared to this stuff.)\nIt is mighty good to be down here, Sam. First of all, the\namount of dishonesty at FSU was getting too far out of hand--\nand then there were other serious problems with Flynn I\nwon't go into now. We don't have much in the way of equipment\nhere, but the staff is far above average and we have the hardest\nworking President I have ever seen. Students are about the same\nwhereever one goes, but this is the first time in three years\nthat I can't get to bed early enough in order that I may get up\nand go to work early. In other words, I'm having a wonderful lib*\nin teaching-and I’m mighty glad I didn't run away from it all.\nCordi\nRaymond D. \\Cheydleur, Prof.\nChairman, Dept, of Speech"
