  "text": "Mr. Harry Skomia\nOctober 13, 1953\n-a-\nfor profit also applicable to 16 m films, film strips, projected trans¬\nparencies and elides, microfilms, sound, recordings, and catalogs of\nsuch materials, when sent to or from (a) schools, colleges, universities,\nor public libraries, and (b) religious, educational, scientific,\nphilanthropic, agricultural * labor, veterans'1 or fraternal organisations,\nor associations, not organised for profit.\nSince Sections 34*83 and 34*84 of the Postal Regulations stem from the\nforegoing legislation and are a codification of this legislation, any\ndesired changes would have to bo brought about by further legislation\nand cannot be accomplished by merely requesting the Post Office to change\nits regulations ■=— or the Interstate Commerce Comission to enlarge the\nscope of the parcel post zones. In this connection, it may be of interest\nto you to know that the Postmaster General and the Bureau of the Budget\nopposed the enactment of Public Law 141 because of the resulting reduction\nin revenues and its adverse effect upon the continuing postal deficit.\nThe Congress, however, from their report felt strongly that the benefits\nto be derived from the \"widest possible dissemination of information both\neducational and cultural purposes is essential to our national welfare,\"\nand outweighed the considerations presented by the Postmaster General\nand the Bureau of the Budget.\nAlthough additional legislation would be necessary to correct the dis~\ncriminatory effects of tha new postal rates upon NAEB tape recordings,\nyou of course realise that the tax-exempt status of MSB precludes it\nfrom lobbying. This prohibition, however, does not extend to the\nindividual members of MSB.\nI hope you will find the foregoing information helpful, and that you will\nlet ms know if there is anything else I can do.\nSincerely,\ncopied 4/14/54vc\nMarcus Cohn"
