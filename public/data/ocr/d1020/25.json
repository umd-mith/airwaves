  "text": "Page 3\nMembers of the Board NAEB\nFebruary 9, 1954\nI mentioned this side to Mitch. He intends to check\nthe problem. Perhaps his discussion with Columbia will\nbreak through the argument. It seems to me that the\nmaster should be corrected before any order goes in for\na new pressing of albums.\nIn general comment, the reputation of EBF and of its field\npersonnel in my region is excellent. I assume that all directors\nare able to judge the organization in their individual regions, aid\nthat the reputation of EBF is of high order. In my opinion EBF\nwill sell the albums in quantity if this can be done. If there\nisn9t a market, we have little to lose anyway.\nA prompt answer is needed by EBF since a catalogue is in\npreparation. Prominent space xvould be given WAEB in the publica¬\ntion but printing cannot be delayed much longer since the catalogue\nis to be used in selling this spring.\nThe alternative to EBF is to have the bookstore at the University\nof Illinois distribute the albums. They would accept orders, bill,\nmail, store. NAEB would still have to maintain the supply but would\nhave no paper work. Under this arrangement WAEB would receive $20\nfrom a list price of $25. This would leave a net per album of\napproximately $13 instead of $1Q~$12 under the EBF arrangement. Of\ncourse, NAEB would not have increased it's price but neither would it\nhave a conntry-wide promotion nor a staff of 40 experienced salesmen\nto increase the sales.\nWill you please write to Harry Skornia to indicate whether\nyou favor distribution via EBF or the U. of I. Bookstore. I know\nthat my presentation is colored by my own judgment of the course\nfor us to choose. As I see it, the odds favor the gamble to see\nwhether real sales effort will bring a significant return.\nSincerely,\nAllen Miller\nAM; gb\nccs Members of the Board\nMaurice B« Mitchell\nGeorge Probst"
