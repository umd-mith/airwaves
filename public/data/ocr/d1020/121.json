  "text": "Additional Suggestions For NAEB Board or Committee Consideration\n1. Will there be any money available for regional meetings this year?\n2. Will there be any opportunity for regions to sit together at any\nconvention dinner or luncheon? I feel that, if we want to build\nregional unity, we need to have a chance to meet the people in the\nregion.\n3. Promotion Sheets for all programs offered on the Network,\nWould it be possible to send promotion sheets for each series and\nperhaps for each program, similar to those sent out for THE WAYS\nOF MANKIND and JEFFERSONIAN HERITAGE?\nThe more staffs are cut the harder it is to find time to do a good\njob of publicity. I feel that this help would be welcomed all over\nthe country. We certainly stamp our stations by the quality of our\nnews releases.\ncc-Mr. Ausmus\nMr. Schooley\nMr. Segiel"
