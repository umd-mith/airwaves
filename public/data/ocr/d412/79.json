WOI runs from\n6:00 a.m. until local sunset, and W0I-PM runs from\nip:00 p.m. until 11:00 at night. When things are\ngoing well, this is fine, but when we blow a gasket,\nthe shrieks and moans are wonderful to hear.\nBest wishes to you and yours for a Merry Christmas\nand a happy and successful New Year!\nSincerely\nRichard B.
