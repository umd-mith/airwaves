WASHINGTON ~7, D.C.\nApril 8, 1963\nMiss Marion Corwell\nAssociate Director — School Relations\nDearborn Public Schools\n5757 Neckel\nDearborn, Michigan\nDear Miss Corwell:\nThank you for your letter of April 5»\nI was rather surprised to learn from your letter that NAEB\nwas asking me to serve another term on the Public Relations Com¬\nmittee. In view of my inexperience in publicity, which seems\nto be the main concern of the PR Committee, I do not believe\nI could make any real contribution to the committee's work.\nFurthermore, AAUW plans to abolish its Mass Media program as of\nJune 30, and I shall no longer be serving as Associate for Mass\nMedia.\nUnder the circumstances, I am sure you will understand my\nreluctance to accept a reappointment to the committee. I am\nwriting to Mr, Harley to express my regret that I cannot continue\nto serve.\nWith best wishes for the committee's future,\nSincerely,\n/'IjXmccl*\nFrances E. Butler\nStaff Associate -\nMass Media\nFEB:cbe"
