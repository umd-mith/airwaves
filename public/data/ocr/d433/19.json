Each year requests are\nreceived for speakers, lecturers and advisers to make the\nworld of television more meaningful to the public. These\nengagements are filled by members of the Academy, and you\nare invited to participate in this exciting work which\nbenefits not only the public and the industry, but the\nAcademy itself.\nIf you wish to offer your services as a speaker,\nlecturer or adviser, please fill out the enclosed ques¬\ntionnaire and return it in the enclosed envelope. At a\nlater date you will be asked to meet with a member of the\nSpeakers Bureau Committee so that we may know how best to\nuse your abilities in the Bureau's work.\nAll travel and maintenance expenses are paid for our\nvolunteers by the organization they serve. Since each\nChapter serves its own geographic area, a journey of more\nthan an hour or two is rarely required.\nAll arrangements for engagements you may wish to fill\nwill be made in consultation with you and at your conven¬\nience.
