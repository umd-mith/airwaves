We decided to take\nthe following action:\n1. An announcement is to be made in the NAEB News Letter\nrequesting members to nominate resource people. We\ndecided the guide should be for resource people rather\nthan just speakers. The nominator is to indicate the\ntopic areas which the resource person will advise.\n2. NAEB, through its staff and the public relations committee,\nshall select resource people from the nominations sent in.\n3. Those selected will receive a detailed questionnaire gathering\nvital information from the person nominated.\n4. A meeting will be called to put together the publication.\nThis meeting will be called by NAEB.\n5. The guide for resource personnel will then be published.\nI am in the process now of drafting the News Letter announcement which\nI will send to you and Harold Hill. Harold seemed satisfied that we are\nmoving in the right direction. I hope these steps will meet with your\napproval.\nLee E. Campion\nDirector\nLEC:rt\ncc: Mr. Harold Hill"
