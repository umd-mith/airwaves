  "text": "A Look at\nCAPITALISM\nNeither Socialism nor Communism ever will be¬\ncome established in the U. S. A. if each generation\nof Americans gets a clear understanding of our\nAmerican system of capitalism, how it works, and\nthe comparative advantages it produces for all\ncitizens. This film begins with the word “capital”\nand builds an understanding of the unique system\nof American capitalism which is supported on the\npillars of private ownership of property, the profit\nmotive, and the free market. Dr. Ganus buys 10-\ncents worth of clay and molds a child’s toy, to be\nfired, decorated and sold in the market for 39-cents.\nAll the elements of the capitalistic system are shown\nat work. Through discussion, the profit motive is\nshown to be wholesome, a factor in nearly all human\nbehavior; private ownership to be the foundation\nof individual freedom and dynamic incentive; and\nthe free market to be a great economic benefactor\nto the consuming public.\nfrate the workings of capital—\nto the consumer's benefit."
