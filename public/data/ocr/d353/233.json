None of the tapes contain the NAEB standard\nclosing cue, but in most cases there is sufficient latitude so that the tag could be\nadded without exceeding 14:30 if it is necessary#\nMay we ask that when the compliment of stations airing \"Queen of Battle\"\nhas been completed, we be provided a list of Uiose stations so that they may be\nincluded in our required reports.\nI would like to say again how proud we are to have the \"Queen of Battle\"\nseries accepted for distribution by the NAEB# U there is any further help that\nwe may give, please call on us#\nSincerely,\nAEAN G.
