Denmark\nhas been the first country in this area\nto start transmitting TV and depending\non fabourable geographical and topo¬\ngraphical conditions the inhabitants in\nthis flat country have the possibility to\nprofit by this latest technical development.\nIn Sweden and Norway the authorities\nhave hesitated, due to quite contrary\ncircumstances, compared to the advantages\nwhich Denmark enjoys. Sweden started\nlast year with a transmitter in Stockholm\nand during the next five years the TV\nnetwork is authorised to be built up over\nthe whole country. In Norway the\nauthorities recently have determined to\nstart TV transmitting. The Tandberg\nfactory therefore has had no possibility\nto start manufacturing TV receivers\nearlier. Now the development has com¬\nmenced but delivery can not be expected\nwithin one or two years.\n,1\n.h955\n,1953\n/\n/\n/\n/\nMF:s sales reports\n1953—57\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\ny\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\ny\n/i\n//\nJ\n—\n/\n—\n-'\n—-\nJAN FEBR MARS APRIl MAJ JUNI JULI AUG SEPT OKT NOV DEC\nMASKIN & ELEKTRO however star¬\nted on the TV market last year and\nsucceded in getting the representation\nin Sweden for the American CBS receivers\nan since half a year ago also for the\nlargest English TV manufactory, E.
