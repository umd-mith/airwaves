Our supply here is quite depleted now due to the fact\nthat we sent one-hundred staple copies to the recent DAVI meeting\nin Detroit.\nIn order that we may continue to send out sample Journals as\nC*ey are requested, would you please ship us any available extra\ncopies as soon as possible.\nThanks very much, Mr. Jennings.\nKindest personal regards.\nSincerely,\nJohn Adams Rourke\nNational Membership Chairman\nAERT\ncc: Professor Leo A. Martin"
