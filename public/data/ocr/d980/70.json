Here's what we have been up to*\nAt about every month interval we have sent membership forms, duplicated\nfrom those received from your office, with letters of encouragement, explanation,\netc* to every eligible should-be member in the area* We sent one such list\nout on our own, but found that lists of active and proposed members from you\nwere a distinct help* Checking a list of active members against all the should-\nbe members which you sent us, we were able to send material throughout 10 or\n12 states in our region* I never met the young man from West Virginia Univ¬\nersity whom you referred to, but like everybody else at a university we can\nfeel sure that he is both short of ready cash and a victim of a very highly\ndeveloped bureaucracy*\nSince the division of property seems to be of world-wide acceptance\nthese days, I don*t see why AERT should prove an exception* You were quite\nright in thinking that the Southeastern region is just too much territory for\nanyone to give any degree of thoroughness. The greatest sales approach in the\nworld is personal contact or acquaintanceship and this we cannot achieve, and\nI therefore, can urge you to make a formal proposal along the lines you\nmentioned*"
