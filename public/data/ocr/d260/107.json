I appreciate your sending me the list of films and\nkinescopes that are available in your instructional television film\nlibrary.\nI would certainly like to have the opportunity of viewing several\nsample films during the next couple of months at your convenience.\nThe following would be of particular interest:\n1. DNA Molecule and Reproduction. Philadelphia Schools\nand C.B.C.\n2. The Endless Adventure. Assoc. Rediffusion\n3. Mine is Heavier. France\n4. Kabuki. Japan\n5. American History 11th Grade. MPATI.\nAs I mentioned during our discussion in Philadelphia, the NAEB Com¬\nmittee on Instructional Television (of vh ich I am chairman) has had a\nproject to make available to television teachers and directors, examples\nof television instruction on 16mm film or kinescope. There seems to\nbe a great deal of interest in having such examples available so that\ndirectors and teachers can gather new ideas and raise the general standards\nof instructional television. There is an interest furthermore in having ex¬\namples from various instructional levels - elementary, secondary, college\nundergraduate and post graduate (e.g., in-service teacher training, adult\neducation and professional training(doctors)."
