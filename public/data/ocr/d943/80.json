  "text": "Hi\nMiss McCance added: \"Each year, we in the Province of Manitoba try to pre¬\nsent one experimental series. This year our experiment will center around clear\nthinking. We shall do what we can to combat the general tendency toward confor¬\nmity. We want to stimulate the pupils to think and to develop as individuals.\nWe encourage student, as well as teacher comment on all programs and welcome con¬\nstructive criticism.\"\nWednesday, June 9th,was devoted to the writer*s problems of organization:\norganization of material, organization of an individual program, organization of\na series. Mrs. Helen Stanley led the morning session, which was concerned with\nthe organization of materials as a preparation for script writing. Miss Betty\nGirling led the afternoon session, which was concerned with the factors which de¬\ntermine organizing a program or a series. After each of these two general ses¬\nsions, guests from the St. Louis Public Schools, who work closely with Station\nKSLH, spoke briefly on their specialties.\nMrs. Stanley first discussed the value of the \"Pre-Writing Period\" as a\nnecessary session of thought and inspiration. \"As creative people, we must re¬\ncreate for ourselves a child*s world. Children today have problems and feelings\nthat were not ours. We must re-discover this child’s world each year we work.\"\nThe danger, she felt, lay in thinking of children as statistics. Instead, the\nwriter needs to personalize the individual child in his audience; to see him,\nto know and to love and to write for one particular child he knows.\nWithin this frame of reference, the writer should then take advantage of\nradio’s intimacy, its personal appeal, by using intimate, personal subject matter.\nThe writer needs to be sensitive to experiences and material around him in order\nto write characters and situations which are real. \"Children have a dreadful\ninsight and an awesome wisdom.\""
