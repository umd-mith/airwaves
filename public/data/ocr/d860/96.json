By\nCaleb Perry Patterson. 211 pp.\nAustin: University of Texas Press. $4.\nBy COLEMAN ROSENBERGER\n^•yHE principles of Jeffer-\nI son,” wrote Abraham Lin¬\ncoln in 1859, “are the definitions\nand axioms of free society.”\nSuch is the Jeffersonian heri¬\ntage. His is the most durable\nstatement, eloquent and Euclid-\nclear, of the faith of the Found¬\ning Fathers and the principles\nupon which our nation was\nerected. It is a standard by\nwhich free men in every genera¬\ntion may test their freedom and\nfrom which they may draw in¬\nspiration and renewal.\n“It is now no child's play,”\nadded Lincoln, “to save the\nprinciples of Jefferson from to¬\ntal overthrow in this nation.”\nThis has been a recurring chal¬\nlenge. In Jefferson’s own day\nJames Madison, his friend and\nconfederate, saw the need “to\ntake alarm at the first experi¬\nment on our liberties.” Lincoln,\nin his, saw \"the vanguard, the\nminers and sappers of returning\ndespotism.” Our own generation\nis not immune.\nJefferson, who wrote “I have\nsworn upon the altar of God\neternal hostility to every form\nof tyranny over the mind of\nman,” would understand today’s\nfight against totalitarianism. He\nwould understand, too, the\nforces of demagoguery and in¬\ntolerance which would exploit\nthat fight.\nWe can all be thankful for\nthe great new monuments of\nJefferson scholarship in our\ntime—the Princeton edition of\nhis papers, the comprehensive\nstudies in biography—which are\nilluminating the principles of\nJefferson and making an under¬\nstanding of them more widely\navailable.\nDumas Malone, whose biog¬\nraphy in progress is one of\nthese monuments of the first\nimportance, has in “The Jeffer¬\nsonian Heritage” guided a work\ndesigned to reach an even\nwider audience. Here are the\ntexts *of a series of radio broad¬\ncasts, produced under a Ford\nFoundation grant, whose pur¬\npose is to present the ideas of\nJefferson in dramatic form.\nMr. Malone forked closely\nwith four abre writers, and him¬\nself provided a summary com¬\nmentary on “What the Jeffer¬\nsonian Heritage Means Today.”\nFour scripts were written by\nMorton Wishengrad, four by\nMilton Geiger, two by Joseph\nMindel, and two by George\nProbst. It has been a fruitful\ncollaboration.\nA decade ago Sidney Kings¬\nley’s stirring play “The Patri¬\nots,” originally entitled “Jeffer¬\nson,” demonstrated the dramat¬\nic possibilities of Jefferson’s\nlife and ideas. The twelve\nscripts here are more faithful\nto Jefferson—as would be ex¬\npected of an enterprise in which\nMr. Malone has had a hand—•\nand they are more heavily\nfreighted with Jefferson’s ideas.\nThe authors have allowed\nthemselves latitude with time\nand place and incident, but the\nwords of Jefferson are often\ndirect quotations from his\nwritings. These have been\nchosen with a view to their\nrelevance for today.\n| N “The Constitutional Prin¬\nciples of Thomas Jefferson”\nCaleb Perry Patterson, Profes¬\nsor of Government at the Uni¬\nversity of Texas, ably summa¬\nrizes from the whole -bodv of\nThe Independent\nMr. Jefferson\nTELEVISION — Reviewed Sunday (5),\n1-1:30 p.m., EDT. Sustaining via WNBT,\nNew York. Producer-director, Ben Park.\nWriter, Morton Wishengrad. Additional\ndialog, Robert Hartman. Cast: William\nPrince, Henry Jones, Robin Humphrey,\nJack Lester, Don Julian, Art Peterson,\nCarl Stohm, Ken Nordine, Joseph Gal-\nlicchio orchestra.\nThe National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters pro¬\nduced a top-drawer line-up of\ntaped radio shows last year under\na $300,000 grant from the Ford\nFoundation. This year, the NAEB\nhopes to do a similar programing\njob in TV. The project got off to\na fine start last week via the\nNAEB's first video entry, a half-\nhour kine drama tagged \"The In¬\ndependent Mr. Jefferson.\"\nNAEB’s first video show was\nadapted for TV from the Associa¬\ntion’s radio series, “Jeffersonian\nHeritage,” which featured Claude\nRains. William Prince plays the\ngreat American patriot in the TV\nversion, and he is as quietly force¬\nful in the role as Rains was in the\nradio original. The kine was aired\nas a one-shot over WNBT, New\nYork, and will be made available\nas a public service to commercial\nJefferson’s writings his views\non constitutional government\nand examines them against\ntheir historical background. He\nhas approached his work as a\nconservative in the true sense,\nas one who would preserve the\nbasic concepts of our Govern¬\nment, recalling George Mason’s\nringing words in the Virginia\nDeclaration of Rights: “No free\ngovernment, or the blessings of\nliberty, can be preserved to any\npeople, but * * * by a frequent\nrecurrence to fundamental prin¬\nciples.” By his organization of\nJefferson’s views, and his anal¬\nysis of them, Mr. Patterson\nperforms the valuable service of\nmaking easier that “recurrence\nto fundamental principles.”\nEach of the volumes here, in\nits own way, illuminates those\ndefinitions and axioms of Jef¬\nferson which stand, in Lincoln’s\nphrase, as “a rebuke and a\nstumbling-block to the very\nharbingers of reappearing tyr¬\nanny and oppression.”\nMr. Rosenberger, a member\nof the Virginia bar, is editor of\n\"Jefferson Reader,” an anthol¬\nogy showing what Jefferson\nhas meant to many different\nminds at many different times.\nJULY 25, 1953\nbroadcasters (on a sustaining ba¬\nsis) as well as NAEB member\nstations.\nThe first TV Jefferson script\nwas largely based on the radio’s\nseries first show “The Living Dec¬\nlaration,” which spotlighted Jef¬\nferson’s writing of the Declara¬\ntion of Independence, and his un¬\nsuccessful attempt to include a\nclause freeing the Negro slave.\nIn many ways the video version\nwas better than the radio series.\nThe use of inexpensive, simple\nsets and comparatively few play¬\ners may have been an economical\nmeasure, but the net results im¬\nbued the tale with an appealing\nquality of intimacy and human\ninterest seldom associated with\nhistorical dramatizations.\nThis effect was heightened by\nthe cast’s brilliant underplaying,\nparticularly that of Prince and\nDon Julian, who portrayed Jef¬\nferson’s grateful slave. Altho the\ndialog included many authentic\nJeffersonian remarks, Prince de¬\nlivered them with quiet convic¬\ntion as tho they were truly his\nown — an achievement compar¬\nable to that of a Shakespearean\nactor who manages to breathe\nspontaneity into the Bard’s oft-\nrecited lines.
