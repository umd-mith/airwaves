Skornia\nN.A.E.B. ;» :d 1954\nGregory Hall ** PM\nUniversity of Illinois l2.'8i4i5,G\nUrbana, Illinois ^ ! ‘ 1\nDear Harry Skornia:\nIn some recent traveling on the Rockefeller Foundation\npoetry project which I am conducting, I have talked with\nRobert Tucker at the University of Massachusetts, Amhurst,\nand heard a number of the \"New England Anthology\" tapes\nwhich were prepared for N.A.E.B. under Mr. Tucker’s direction.\nIn my own project I am dealing partly with the work of\nWallace Stevens? who made one of the Tucker tapes, and an\nexcellent tape it is. I have, of course, talked at length\nwith Mr. Stevens and he is cooperating in the preparation of\nmy material. In one of my recordings I am much in need of\nMr. Stevens’ reading of certain of his poems, and I wonder\nif you could arrange to have a good copy of the reading done\nfor the Tucker series sent to me by the N.A.E.B, -From this\nreading I should wish to dub on to a recording of my own\nMr. Stevens’ rendition of the poem \"The Idea of Order at\nKey West\". For my purposes it should be at 7^.\nI.am sure this tape will make its way around the net¬\nwork circuit sooner or later, but my need for it is imme¬\ndiate, and I would appreciate your cooperation or advice\nfor obtaining s special dubbing.\nFor the same purpose if copies can be provided me with¬\nout great difficulty, I should like also the reading of\nRichard Eberhart which was included in Mr. Tucker’s series.\nI shall, of course, be glad to pay the tape costs out of the\nRockefeller budget.\nSincerely yours\no 1/\nLewis Hill\nlh; em"
