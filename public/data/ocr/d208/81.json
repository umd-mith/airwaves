I suggest we contact him further and\nwork out some details if that is our function. I assume the Acceptance\nCommittee will then decide if the series is worthwhile.\nThe Castell series was quite well received in this area, even\neliciting a few comments on FM which is impressive in this sparse FM\narea. The three series outlined by Starlin appear to me to have dis¬\ntinct possibilities, inasmuch as the Ivory Tower and Invitation shows\nwere good for their type. My vote would be to close in on this to the\npoint of offering some concrete proposal to the Acceptance people.\nAs for the Chilean school-boy series, I am dubious. Certainly we\nwould have to hear sorre tapes and know more about the quality before\nwe could decide. Anyway, hasn’t that been fairly well taken out of the\nreluctant hands of this committee?\nAs you can see by this time, I am perhaps a little vague about the\nfunction of this committee, and espedially in regard to these letters,\nI hope you plan a meeting some time, so I can get a little or&eAied to\nthe work of the oommittee. Let me hear from you sometime.\nincerely.\nKedneth D. Weight\nDirector of Broadcasting"
