C.\nTO THE EDITOR:\nLeaders of public information media are mobi¬\nlizing support for the White House Conference on\nHighway Safety, which President Eisenhower has\ncalled for February 17, 18 and 19, in Washington.\nYou will doubtless be hearing more about this\nsoon from the Conference Media Group, headed by\nCharles F. McCahill of the CLEVELAND NEWS,\nimmediate past president of the American News¬\npaper Publishers Association.\nMeanwhile, I thought that you would like to\nhave the attached “Fact Sheet’’ concerning the\nConference, and a copy of President Eisenhower’s\nletter to the forty-eight Governors, asking their co¬\noperation. Perhaps this material may suggest ideas\nfor news or feature article, editorials or cartoons.\nH. B. Miller, Rear Admiral,\nU.S.N., Retired\nConference Director"
