Again my apologies for missing last issue; I’m sure\nit won’t happen again. I’m very interested in the de Tocque-\nville scripts since I've read them; what should the next\nstep be? Are we to submit some program suggestions as a\nsubcommittee, as individuals, or just what would you prefer?\nThings are damn hectic here with new studio and transmitter\nconstruction. We're really building a new PM station, going\nfrom 3400 to 80,000 watts if the free equipment we've received\ncan be adapted. But with more staff now, I think I can devote\nsome time to program planning once I understand what procedure\nto follow.\n^Kln Wr\nSincere regards\n9\nn Wright\nKW:ss"
