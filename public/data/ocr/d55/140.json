Were content of these ’’rare editions,” provided\nthey were rare editions of any significance, given a sub¬\nstantial consideration, I would vote “yes*”\n2. But the mechanics and statistics of ’’rare editions”\nappears to me to be of so little general interest as to be\nalmost negligible. It could be properly noted as an appendage\nto the more important elements of content and ideas expressed\nin the rare editions#\n3* The program is satisfactory from a production^\nstandpoint.\nUrey Lecture and other Univ. of Louisville programs: Yes\nObviously this sort of thing could be done on the net¬\nwork, but so far it hasn*t. Until we reach that point, the\nnet should continue to offer the lectures of distinguished\nscholars and scientists."
