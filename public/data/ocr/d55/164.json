Mix, 1\nSUBJECT: American Traditions in Art\nand Rare Editions\nAs a new member of this committee, I think it would be helpful to have\nsome definition of the criteria to be applied in judging the fitness of\nprograms for the NAEB network. It seems to me that, not only resources,\nbut the application of those resources in producing a program are im¬\nportant.\nThe two latest programs submitted to the network, \"American Traditions in\nArt \"and \"Rare Editions\", are two cases in point.\nThe latter program, \"Rare Editions\", while rather dull and uninteresting to\nme personally, was at least presented with some imagination. The people\nin charge of the program were not satisfied to let the Evanston book col¬\nlector carry the program alone, but drew in others of note interested in\nthe collection and publication of rare books. For my money, this is an\nexample of going beyond the absolute minimum effort required simply to\nget a program on the air, and for this reason I vote yes on \"Rare Editions.\"\n\"American Traditions in Art,\" however, was presented with as little effort\nand imagination as possible, short of having merely dead air. While it’s\ntrue that a recognized authority on art presents the program it doesn*t\nmean very much. In the first place, the person speaking is not even\nidentified. This is a smaller matter, of course, and can be easily re¬\nmedied. The important thing is that we can do a better job here on our\nown staff. We have announcers who read better than Mr. Rothschild and\nare more pleasing to listen to, and all the material he has we can get\nfrom the library. In short, the program offers nothing that is not avail¬\nable anywhere. My vote on Art: no.\nHMMsln\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS"
