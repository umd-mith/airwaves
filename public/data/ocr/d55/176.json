MiXyt^\nDATE: November 30, 1955\nSUBJECT: To Make Men Free, The Fourth R,\nThe Playroom\nTO MAKE MEN FREE: I feel it is unfortunate that this program takes so\nnarrow a view of the Civil War. I know the point is made in the application\nthat the Southern viewpoint is represented, and I think this is probably\ntrue. Nevertheless, the very fact that it is clearly announced at the\nbeginning of the programs as Michigan*s story of the Civil War will prejudice\nmany Southern listeners. I just don*t think the setting for the program\nis right for a program of national scope. Otherwise it is excellent.\nVote ’’no’*.\nTHE FOURTH R: One of the most fascinating programs I have heard in a long\ntime. The guy who does the program is absolutely right. I wonder if it\nwould be possible to do a series of fifteen minute programs in this vein.\nVote \"yes**.\nTHE PLAYROOM: This program is too \"loaded.” Sound effects dominate through¬\nout to the extent that it*s distracting even to an adult. I'm sure that\nchildren would lose interest in the program before it was five minutes old.\nThe show is neither original enough nor imaginative enough to offset the\npoor production. Vote \"no”."
