Mix, WNAD\nDATE:\nSUBJECT: Report on Europe (WBAA)\nThe Wandering Ballad Singer (KVSC)\nMy vote is \"yes\" for both series.\nThe program from WBAA is especially good, at least the one I heard. Here\nis an example of the kind of thing I mentioned in my last letter. How\neasy it would have been for Mr. McMahon simply to sit in front of a micro¬\nphone and talk. But he does nothing of the kind. The effort made here\nis imaginative and all out with plenty of on-the-spot material to make\nthe program authentic, informative and entertaining. We need more programs\nlil® this one.\nThe KVSC program is not so good, but nevertheless acceptable. To mention\nthe least important thing first, the announcing could be improved on a\ngood deal. Aside from that, however, the program seems to need some more\ndefinite theme or motif. We have done two series similar to this one here\nat WNAD. We found that adding purpose to the program by careful selection\nof ballads building a theme or thread of continuity makes the program. The\nKVSC program is more a random selection of folk tunes with nothing to hold\nthem together. I would much prefer asking KVSC to build the series along\nthis line before final submission to the network if the committee agrees."
