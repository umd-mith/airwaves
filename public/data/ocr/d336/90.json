If the NAEB did not take this\nview, it might well retreat from the communications area and leave it to\ncommercial groups in which self-support is a primary consideration. And if\nAmerica is to have a truly alternative supplementary service, it is not believed#\nlikely that this will be allowed to occur.\nThe NAEB therefore is both confident of the future, and proud of its last\nfew years and months as it respectfully submits herewith, its reports and re¬\nquests, and expresses, once again, its sincere appreciation for the support and\nunderstanding of the W. K. Kellogg Foundation.\nRespectfully submitted on behalf of\nPresident Graydon Ausmus and the\nNAEB Board of Directors\nH. J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nJune 22, 1954\nUrbana, Illinois"
