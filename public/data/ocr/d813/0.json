March 13 and lij. are the best dates for us at the University.\nThey seem to be the best dates from NAEB’s point of view and also\nfrom the point of view of those who would attend the conference.\nEnclosed are copies of (a) a wire I sent to every active and associ¬\nate member in this region and (b) copies of replies to that wire\nfrom 19 of the 23 member organizations. These replies, I believe,\nindicate an overwhelming interest in participating in a Region Ii\nWorkshop.\n2. For reasons of expense and that the workshop should be\nstrictly a \"family” affair, perhaps the out-of-town speakers and\nconsultants should be limited to Ausmus, Miles, Paulu and Schooley.\nIn addition, I hope it will be possible to bring Sy Siegel and\nJohn Dunn to Chapel Hill. I would like Sy, as past president,.to\nreport on the achievements of the NAEB and John Dunn to lend his\nprestige of having already run a regional conference to our work¬\nshop .\n3. Because of the size of this region the workshop will not\nbe inexpensive. I have figured out the expense involved in bring¬\ning one member from each active and each associate member organi¬\nzation to the workshop. This expense is based on pullman (lower\nberth), round trip to Chapel Hill and in the case of Jose A.\nBuitrago, air travel from Puerto Rico. It includes also the cost"
