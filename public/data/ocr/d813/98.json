Without a basic philosophy\nof operation for all stations, it would be presumptous\nto say it is wrong to use many students in any single\noperation. And although it is most difficult to.set.\nstandards or to say that many of the larger institutions\nare doing a better job of programming than the smaller\norganizations, it is certainly apparent that these\ninstitutions do not rely on students for fullfilling\nkey positions. This study does not in any sense try to\nmeasure the quality of programming (which, after all,\nis a somewhat subjective problem,) or to relate the\nquality of programming with the size of budgets. It\ndoes appear important, however, that smaller stations\nplace a tremendous amount of reliance upon student per¬\nsonnel.\nAverage num¬\nber of paid\nHourly students per\nRate station\nAverage num¬\nber of un¬\npaid students\nper station\nColleges and Universities $ .77 9 29\n10 watts\nColleges and Universities\n250-5,000 watts, AM and/ 1.04 9 0\no r FM\nublic chools and Boards .86 2 0\nof Education\nOther Institutions"
