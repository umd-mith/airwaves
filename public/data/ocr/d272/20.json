  "text": "TAPE SUPPLY\nWith the advent of the leg system and a continuing\nincrease in activity there developed a serious shortage of\ntape. The program acceptance committee sent out a frantic\nappeal to member stations asking them to come to the rescue\nof the network. Thirteen stations responded nobly with a\ntotal of 240 reels of tape. This combined with the supply\nalready in use makes a total of approximately 450 reels now\nin the possession of the network. The word approximate is\nused because there are still some tapes in circulation which have\nnever been in our possession. This supply has been adequate for\nthis interim period*\nIt is recommended that when the basic tape supply has\nbeen obtained the stations making these contributions be repaid\nin kind* Since this was not a general levy but a purely voluntary\nact to help out in an emergency it seems fair to return the tapes\nwith our thankso\nV;e have also undertaken to number all of the NAEB tapes*\nThis process, while somewhat tedious, facilitates the keeping of\na running inventory as well as making positive identification\neasier*\nOne additional problem in connection with tape needs to\nbe mentioned* According to the engineers, it will be necessary\nto standardize on tape for use with the mass duplicator. Apparently\nthe recording characteristics are not identical in different brands\nof tape. Thus, when ten tapes are being dubbed at a tinfe the HP\nof a standard tape is the only way of avoiding differences in\nlevel and nuality*\n-10-"
