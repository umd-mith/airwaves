At this moment the noise\nof trip hammers, concrete mixers, and other renovation and addition\nactivities under us and on all sides of us is enough to drive a man\ncrazy* We anticipate launching programs by January of '55*\nFy warmest and kindest personal regards* I hope I may have the pleasure\nof seeing you in New York*\ni\n■ V\nSincerely yours.\nGraydon Ausmus\nPresident\nGA:ap"
