  "text": "MEMORANDUM\nlh February 19f>3\nTO: Officers and Directors MSB\nFROM: Burton PauXu\nSUBJECT: Membership Application of Providence Bible Institute\nI Just finished looking over John Dunn’s laeiaorsnduai of February 10, 1953,\nrelative to several applications for NAEB memberships, one of which is from the\nProvidence Bible Institute.\nI m voting ttyesn on all of tbs applications in this lot except for this\nbible institute. My reason for withholding approval of them is that the only\ninformation available as to their accreditation la that they are \"Accredited by\nCollegiate Division of the Accrediting Association of *>ible Institutes and Bible\nColleges,’*\nThe thing :*e should insist upon is that when we sre dealing with educational\ninstitutions or schools, they be accredited by the state universities of their\nrespective states. This is $ practice generally followed in educational circles,\nand I think we should do likewise. Most of these bible institutes srs not so\naccredited which is probably the reason they set up their cm accrediting organ!-\nnation.\nIf and when this bible institute is accredited by the state university of\nRhode Island — meaning that if it is of high school rank its graduates are\nreceived by the university, or if of college rank, its credits are transferable\nto the university — I will certainly vote yes$ otherwise I shall vote no,\nLet me state at this time that I think the Term John has adopted in circu¬\nlating applications far membership is an excellent one. It supplies us with the\ninformation we need and with a convenient ballot, Congratulations, John, for the\nw&y you bring these matters to our attention!\nBpjcjm"
