  "text": "TO: Officers and Directors of HAEB DATE: 12 August 1952\nFROM: Burton Paulu\nSUBJECT: ilemorandum of August 7 from John W# Dunn, Chairman Membership\nCommittee, Relative to Applications from Flint and Battleereek,\nMichigan\nOf course I m ready and willing to vote into Active Membership the\nBoard of Education of the City 0f flint and to Associate Membership the\nBattlocreek Public Schools,\nHowever I would like to raise a question of form. In his memorandum\nJohn says^ \"If no protests are received in the office of the Executive\nDirector of NAEB by August 20th, 1952, the applications ss noted below\nwill be considered passed by the Board of Directors and the applicants\nwill be so notified by the Executive Director,\"\nThis may be a somewhat pic punish point to raise-, but Article I5\nSection (/) of our constitution nays: \"Any university, college, school,\nor other educational or public service agency of recognised standing\nengaged in educational, noncommercial broadcasting over a radio station\ncontrolled by it, or holding a construction permit for such a station,\nmay be elected to membership by the Board of Directors,\"\nI wonder if the underlined phrase dcesn* t require positive action\nrather “than the absence of a veto? That is, doesn't this require a majority\nof a quorum of the Board to*\"vote”'affirmatively on an application to member¬\nship rather than merely the absence of any protests?\nPerhaps Brother Frank Schocley, our constitutional interpretor. can\ngive us some guidance here."
