Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nAugust 10, 1956\nTo: ALL NETWORK STATIONS\nFrom: NETWORK MANAGER\nRe: SPECIAL HI-FI OFFERING\nThis as to clarify the basis on which stations may obtain the special\nHI-FI PROGRAMS OFFERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE i+TH QUARTER, 1 95& REGULAR\nPROGRAM OFFER IN6o\nDue to the few number of hi-fi tapes we were able to have duplicated,\nWE cannot permit stations to select certain series from the special\nOFFERING AND REJECT OTHERS. STATIONS WILL HAVE TO TAKE EITHER ALL OF\nTHE SERIES OR NONE OF THEM®\nThis sounds like a hard bargain, but remember that you can take all of\nTHE SPECIAL HI-FI SERIES, AND STILL OBTAIN 6^ HOURS PER WEEK OF THE\nREGULAR OFFERING®\nWe APOLOGIZE FOR NOT MAKING THIS POLICY CLEAR ON THE OFFERING, AND WE\nHOPE THAT NO ONE SUFFERED ANY 6 NOONV£N8ENCE FOR OUR ERROR OF OMISSION®\nPerhaps at a future date we will be able to offer another group of\nHJ-FI TAPES FROM WHICH STATIONS MAY CHOOSE THOSE OF MOST INTEREST\nTO THEM®\nBest regards to all®\nRU:mk\n8/11/56"
