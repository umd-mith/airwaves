European ideas and attitudes on a subject of such\nworld wide concern, should interest many people. I certainly\nhope that the level on all the interviews is high and clear\nenough so that what these aging Europeans with their various\naccents, can be understood. Further, I hope that each of the\nfamous old people interviewed in the various countries do not\nsay substantially the same thing. Nonetheless, I found the\naudition tape very much worthwhile and approve solidly of the\nidea and the manner in which it was handled. Yes.\nSincerely,\nA Jim Slack\n/ / Network Acceptance Committee\nJS/eg"
