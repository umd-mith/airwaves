The purpose of this\nseries is to give a report on the major battles of that war as seen by a specific\nMichigan regiment. In the series the South is treated sympathetically; nevertheless,\nthe primary point of view is Northern, and the focus of attention is placed on\nNorthern troops.\nThe material for the series is taken directly from official records, regimental\nhistories and Adjutant General’s reports. The consultant is E. E. Barthell, author\nof the Civil War section in the Encyclopedia Britannica.\nAlthough great stress is placed on the role of Michigan troops, it was felt that\nthe series would be of general interest in many other areas of the country. Nowhere\nis the impression given that Michigan won the war without assistance.\nThese thirteen programs conclude the series:\nProgram\nIssue\nTopic\n14\n14\nChickamauga (September, I863)\n15\n15\nChattanooga (November, I863)\n16\n16\nKnoxville (December, I863)\n17\n17\nLibby Prison (February, I864)\n18\n18\nThe Wilderness (May, I864)\n19\n19\nSpotsylvania (May, I864)\n20\n20\nCedar Creek (Winchester) (Oct., I864)\n21\n21\nSherman Leaves Atlanta (Nov., I864)\n22\n22\nFranklin (November, I864)\n23\n23\nNashville (December, I864)\n24\n24\nPetersburg (April, 1865)\n25\n25\nAppomattox (April, I865)\n26\n26\nCapture of Jefferson Davis (May, 1865]\nPROGRAM OFFERING\nBONUS"
