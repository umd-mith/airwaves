Y.\nWHitehall 3-3600\nJanuary 17, 1955\nMr. Frank Schooley\nStation WILL\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Frank:\nI am transmitting herewith an explanatory memorandum\nand Appendix 3 to the Statute of the Prix Italia concerning\nthe new \"Italia Prize\" for television.\nYou can see by glancing through the material that we are\nnow entitled to submit a Television Program between 25 and\n85 minutes in length to compete for the 2 million lire prize.\nI am not familiar with the work which has been turned out by\nany of the educational television stations which might fit\ninto this category but it seems to me that notice to all such\nstations is called for and it certainly should provide you with\nthe means of taking the leadership in the television field.\nI think it's time we got going on the radio prizes. This year we\nare sitting on the Documentary Jury so we can submit both a\nmusical entry and a dramatic entry. If you want me to prepare\na notification with all the details to be distributed to other\nstations, I would be happy to do so. In any event, I think you\nwill agree that we ought to get going without delay, if we are\nto come up with something of some import.\nI hope all is going well with you, and with all best wishes,\nCordially yours.\nSeymour N. Siegel\nDirector\nTKe\nsns-lg\nVoice Of The City"
