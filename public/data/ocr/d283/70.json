The mutual respect which\nhas developed among the individuals who have attended* the ccsnsultants who have\nserved, and the NAEB as the facilitating and guiding agency which has planned and\nimplemented these, meetings, has only recently begun to be realised. Many of the\nconsultants hays bscose individual members of the NABB. So have mary of the\nattendees. Th® latter are already grateful and most of them will, we feel sure,\nbecome loyal individual ambers. However, if they do so, it will be because they\nfeel that the NAEB will continue to provide useful services—-not cut of a sense\nof gratitude far past services. The experience of national erganiaatiems generally\nconfirms the need to maintain steady service and imaginative leadership if they are\nto survive in an age when organisational vacuums are rapidly filled.\nWe believe that basically the success of radio and television as educational\ninstruments will depend more and more m the development of a body of such individuals\nas are reached by our seminars and workshqps^welded into a profession under the\nleadership and banner of the NAEB—~or seme other organization, if the NAEB fails\nto fee dynamic and responsive to their needs for continued growth and development.\nThis growing group of professionals (in all but their awareness of professiona¬\nlism) will increase the need for, certainty of the growth of, and chances of success\nof, such a professional organization.\nAt present we are confronted with the problem of conducting self-financing\nseminars. But at the present state of this profession, still a-boming, the in¬\ndividuals from whom we need to secure the sums necessary to support these seminars\ndo not enjoy adequate status in their mcthar-lnstituticns to enable them to secure\nsuch fluids. The NPAC has enjoyed considerable success in this type of seminar"
