Arthur Hungerford, Jr.\n19 Orchard Ridge Road\nChappaqua, New York\nDear Art:\nYou scribbled some notes for me at Omaha, hut in my usual\ndisorganized fashion, managed to lose them. I1® referring to\nyour recent regional conference.\nIn preparing for the Region III convention which is not?\nset for the middle of February it would be most helpful if I\ncould obtain a copy of your agenda. Perhaps you had a printed\nprogram and have an additional copy lying around that you could\nsend to me. If so, I*d appreciate it very ouch.\nI am distressed to hear continuing gloomy reports on the\nMETA situation and sincerely hope that some silver lining will\nemerge before too long. Meanwhile I wish you well on your per¬\nsonal project. May « aspect a new book to emerge from this\nactivity? Or is this Just another genuflection in the cause of\nPhDism?\nIt was good to see you at Omaha and perhaps we can have a\nlonger chat in New York sometime when I get out that way.\nCordially yours.\nWilliam G. Harley\ncc: H. Skornia\n/"
