I have accepted a\nposition there as research professor and will be in charge of\nestablishing, operating, and researching a closed-circuit system\nwhich is expected to include color and a video tape recorder\nwithin three years.\nActually, the general nature of my job will not be greatly changed\ninasmuch as I will also be doing research on programs to the general\npublic prepared by the Medical Center as well as instruction via\nclosed-circuit. I am still interested in maintaining my affiliation\nwith the UAEB and do not see where my new duties will prevent my\nremaining a member of the Research Committee if the Association can\nmake use of my services. I have not made much public announcement\nabout this decision, which I reached back in October. I assume the\nUniversity of California will make some formal announcement shortly\nafter I arrive. However, I am not in any way trying to keep it any\nsecret•\nBest wishes to you for a joyous holiday season and a happy and\nsuccessful I960.\nIRM/ee\ncc: Mr. Harry Skornia\nUrbana, Illinois"
