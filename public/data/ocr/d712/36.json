Seibert\nSenior Research Coordinator\nEducational Media Branch\nDepartment of Health, Education,\nand Welfare\nWashington 25, D* C.\nDear Warren:\nEnclosing the proposals you sent and my summaries* Half of them are\nhere and the other half are coming in another envelope*\nThis was a frustrating job in many ways* First of all, as you know,\nprocedures are not clearly defined in most of the proposals, if they\nare touched upon at all. Except for a very few, there were nothing\nbut vague references to the hypotheses to be tested* I am sure that\nmost of these problems were clarified in conference with the experi¬\nmenters before grants were made but this is not reflected in these\nproposals - except for the illiteracy one. Most provide no infor¬\nmation on sample size or, in a number of cases, on composition of\nthe sample* Anyway, I did the best I could to make them sound sen¬\nsible* I thought that sending me the McLuhan proposal to abstract\nwas an especially low blow!!!\nThe only other problem that I had was in the classification scheme.\nWhen the emphasis was on in-service training of teachers as they are\ntaaching in public schools (as a nuriber of these were), I put ML for\ninstitutional level and TE for content level (e.g., as in proposals\n269 and 253) where the course content was not indicated* When it\nwas, as in the language proposal, I put that. By the way, these will\nlook longer than they really are because they were typed on our large-\ntype electric typewriter. With standard type, they would take up\nmuch less of the page*\nI hope that you find these satisfactory. If not, please let me know.\nBest,\nSamuel L* Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film\nSLB:ks"
