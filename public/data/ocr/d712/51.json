I intend to alter\ncertain questions, but basically this is the questionnaire I intend to\nsend to managers of educational stations.\nAt this point I feel that the study might have some significance other\nthan qualification for a Masters Degree. I have written to a number of\nmen in the field of religious broadcasting. So far, I have found no\nevidence that a study of this type has been done previously. Therefore,\nit might prove of some value to the NAEB.\nI have selected the active members of the NAEB for my universe. I\nintend to contact both educational radio and television stations.\nMr Gail Adkins of the University of Kansas has worked with me as thesis\nadviser! Also, Mr. R. Edwin Browne, Station Manager of KANU is on my\nthesis committee. At their suggestion, I write you this letter in order to\nobtain the approval of the NAEB of my questionnaire.\nI am sincerely interested in this project. I attended a graduate\nPresbyterian seminary for a year and a half and am deeply interested in\nreligious broadcasting. I am presently finishing requirements for a Masters\nDegree in radio and television at the University of Kansas.\nPlease feel free to comment on the questionnaire if you wish.\nSincerely,\n/3k\nBob Brooks\nDepartment of Radio and Television\nUniversity of Kansas"
