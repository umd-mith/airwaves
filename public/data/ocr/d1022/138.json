They are of\nthree general shapes: spherical, rod-shaped, or spiral. They have not tissues\nor organs. Some bacteria are very helpful. They enrich the soil by causing dead\nleaves and other organic matter to decay. In this way many materials are returned\nto the soil to be used as food by later plants. Bacteria also replenish the\nnitrogen supply in the soil, which plants need. However, some bacteria are very\nharmful in causing many diseases. Scientists work to learn how to kill or control\nthese kinds of bacteria.\nThings to Do:\n1. Wash the soil from the roots of an alfalfa or clover plant and see the nodules.\nWhat are they?\n2. Look through a microscope or at enlarged pictures of various kinds of bacteria.\n3. Make lists of ways in which bacteria are helpful; harmful.\nSources:\n1.

A root is an underground part of a plant.\n2. Roots carry minerals and water to the plant.\n3-. Some plants store food in their roots.\nMany plants have roots which grow underground and help the plant in different\nways. The roots carry minerals and water from the soil to other parts of the\nplant. Water is absorbed through very fine root hairs, each of which has a root\ncap at its growing point. This cap protects the root as it grows through the\n-18-"
