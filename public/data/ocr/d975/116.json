If a responsible\neducational broadcaster were to propose a\nprogramming project involving practical, and\nbasic values during daytime and evening hours\non a full-time basis, it would well behoove\nARC (Appalachian Regional Commission) to\nconsider backing such a project to the fullest\nextent of its capability. The people of\nAppalachia, as much and possibly more than any\nother Americans, need effective mass inter¬\ncommunication of information which they will\nfind valuable in their lives. They need it as\nsoon as possible.\"\nThe title of Mr. Fellows' report is \"Educational\nBroadcasting As A Tool For Appalachian Development\",\nand was written in June of 1966."
