Back in 1923 some British newspapers refused to list\nBBC programs (sounds familiar, doesn*t iti)* Accordingly the British\nBroadcasting Company (as it then was called) started its own program\njournal, with terrific success judged by anyone*s standards.\nAt present the Radio Times is published in seven editions—one for\nthe London area, and one for each of the six regions into which the Home\nService network is divided for local broadcast purposes. Its total sale\nis about 8,000,000 copies per week, which gives it the largest circulation\nof any weekly journal in the world. Since the Radio Times carries adver¬\ntising (each copy sells for three pence—about three cents American), it\nis a real money maker for the BBC, bringing over $2,500,000 per year in\nprofits into the Corporation*s tills (which money is then turned back into\nbroadcast expenses.) Each issue contains detailed program listings for the\nthree radio services and for the television service.\nAlthough the Radio Times is the best known and most widely circulated\nBBC publication it is not the only one. The Listener, which reprints\nselected broadcast talks and contains in addition some reviews of books\nand broadcasts, has a weekly circulation of about 135,000. (It sells for\nfour pence—about four cents American.) There is also the BBC Quarterly, a\nscholarly journal which deals with radio and television, with U,000 copies\n19"
