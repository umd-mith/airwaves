Hill\nVice President - NAEB\n3^i6-Connecticut Avenue, N.W,\nSuite 11Dupont Circle Building\n\"*s^a'sliington7 D.C.\nDear Harold:\nI polled the Publications Committee, in line with your request, concerning\nthe possibility of reduced rates for members of other organizations for sub¬\nscriptions to our publications, if we could interest such organizations in\nallowing reduced rates for their publications to our Individual Members.\nNine of the ten committee members have replied to date.\n1. Asked whether they thought the idea was worth exploring, 7 say yes, 1 is\nheartily opposed, and 1 has large reservations. (Actually, I get the definite\nimpression that the 7 who say yes are thinking primarily of their own interests\n—what such a savings on publications of other organizations might mean to\nthem—rather than as members of an NAEB committee and what such an arrangement\nmight mean to the NAEB. The other 2 are opposed or dubious because of poten¬\ntial loss of income to the NAEB, because of questions about how you open the\ndoor for such arrangements to one organization while closing it on another,\nand because of the likelihood that it would be more trouble in promoting,\nbookkeeping etc. than it would be worth.)\n2. Asked what organizations and/or publications they would suggest, these\nwere named:\n1 Journal of Broadcasting (6)\n2 A-V Communication Review (5)\n3 Television Quarterly (4)\n4 Quarterly Journal of Speech (3)\n5 Audiovisual Instruction (2)\n6 Journal of the SMPTE (2)\n7 Journalism Quarterly (1)\n8 Television Digest (l)\n9 Speech Monographs (1)\n10 Speech Teacher (1)\n11, E.B.U. Review (1)\n12 AERA Journal (1)\n13 AHE Journal (1)\n14 Any newsletter which the Center for Programed Learning may put out (1)\n15 British and European journals (1)\nOffices at 59 East Armory, Champaign, Illinois"
