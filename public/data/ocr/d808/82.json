The drawings that will be submitted to us will be\nconceived with these two tones in mind; however the brown may be changed\nto a gray tone if it cannot be used. The artist advised this procedure since\nit would be easier to visialize to_ black than to the different colors. When\nwe have heard from you, however, we may then make further adjustments\nbefore the final layout in this respect.\nShould you need additional information please call on us . I hope that\nour progress thus far has been conformable to your own deadlines. We will\nbe sure to have the final layout to you by September 1st.\nSincerely,\n(-jjCL*Us\n(/ Jane Lombard\nEditor"
