  "text": "Dear NAEB Member?\nThe ROA - Victor people have approved an\nannual fee of $12.00 for the non-commercial,\neducationally* and munioipally owned and\noperated radio stations. The NASB committee\nnow suggests that all members who have not\ndone so, forward to ROA - Victor a payment\nof $12.00 for the first 12 months. If you have\nalready paid any amount to RCA - Victor this\namount will be credited to you and if you\nhave paid more than the one year fee, a refund\nwill be sent you* The suggestion is to fill\nout a form which RCA originally sent you,\nchanging only that section regarding fees,\nmaking it read $12.00 per year.\nSomeone has raised the question regarding\nthe announcement provision of the original\noontraot. It is suggested that no exceptions\nbe made in this case, although I can assure\nyou that this is not ihtended to apply to the\nnon-commercial, educational, and munioipal\nstations and that RCA will take no action\nregarding this announcement and it is not\nintended to apply to the educatiohal stations.\nCordially yours,\nP.S. Again, this is striokly confidential\nto the non-commercial, educational radio\nstations. fas"
