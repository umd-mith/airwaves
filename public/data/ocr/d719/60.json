Skornia\nPresident, National Association\nof Educational Broadcasters\nlh Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nUnder revelant comments on the attached questionnaire I\nhave indicated that I think your suggestion of keeping\ntrack of time spent away from your NAEB desk from mid-\nSeptember to November is ridiculous.\nMatter of fact, it verges on scrupulosity. So what if\nthere is six weeks of over-lapping salary? Your service\nto us during these 6 weeks — whether under the NAEB\nbanner or not — will be as critical as any service you\nhave ever performed. To make too much of issues such as\nthis smacks of pique. \"This is my minute, this is your\nminute. Here we draw the line, Fere are the sums, now I\ndare anybody to say I owe anybody anything.”\nI know you don*t feel that way, but it*s an impression\nI could get.\nBest regards.\nDirector\nEF/as"
