Our relation is a subtle one, and we can't\nforetell the outcome.\nNovik: How will you promote ETV?\nWheatley: We will promote through all groups we can, but because of the nature\nof our organization we don't definitely have citizens on the Board.\nNovik; You could get an advisory council of fifteen citizens. How can a\nstation run without people behind it to do the promotion?\nWheatleys We don't do it. Possibly this is a worn out idea. We’ll get along\nwith good programs first, which the people will follow without citizens in on\nthe planning.\nQuestion: Is that how you get the Boston Symphony?\nWheatley: Yes.\nQuestion: How does a community station with a responsibility beyond the\nresponsibility of the community do its promoting?\nWheatley: Just try to serve the whole community without distinction.\nNovik: You need advertising to put any product over.\nWheatley: Promote, yes, but not by such devices as a board set up through\nthe heads of community groups. Do go through the organizations to create interest\nbut not to form a board.\nFurther Discussion\nFourth General Session\nDr. Harry M. Lyle, Director, Massachusetts Board of Educational Television,\nBoston, served as chairman of the Fourth General Session devoted to a general\nquestion and answer period about the NAEB, Panelists were: Dr. Harry J.
