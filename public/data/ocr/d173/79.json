It is the very first and only time I have ever heard any¬\nthing derogatory to the conduct of any of your clergymen.. *\nWell*.. (THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD)\nBut before you can tell us that we are wrong again, and should\nhave kept our eyes open...\nI wasn8t going to say anything of the kind, sirs ma&e a mistake\nthere.\nI am glad to hear it. But what we have noticed is this: that\nreligion in America is more philosophy than, x-jhat shall I say?\na study in the miraculous. Your clergy speak so often of the goods\nof this world. Very often one meets a politician where one\nexpected to find a priest.\nWell, If youfire interested in the miraculous, I can tell you some¬\nthing that happened in upper Hex; York State; on the banks of the\nSeneca. Been up there?\nHo; but we leave in a day or two for Albany* We hope to be there\nduring your Independence Day celebrations.\nPity you aren*t going to be in Hew York City; this is much more of a\nlive town for a celebration. Hoxfever, x/hat I xras going to tell you\nabout ocoured in upstate New York, The center of the interest was\na lady by the name of Jemima Wilson. Heard of her?"
