Let me see, \"Second Annual Report of the\nNew York Temperance Society\".\nPounded by myself in company with Dr. Eliphalet Nott.\nMost interesting, evidently. W*.et is a Temperance Society?\nIt has to do with the evils of strong drink. I crusade agalhst it.\nOf course, we agree with you. Moderation in all things.\nTemperance, sir, does not mean mode rat ionr~ As far as\" strong\ndrink is concerned, temperence means abstinence. Let me draw your\nattention to some of those fine coloured plates. Section of the\nliver of a drunkard who died miserably some little while since\nin Poughkeepsie. Interior of the stomach of a drunkard who\nperished in agony near Syracuse. Series of cross sections of\nthe spleen...\nThank you, we have seen sufficient.\nWell, they’re fine pictures. I*m working now on something which\n1*11 take the liberty of transmitting to you gentlemen, seeing\nthat you’re from Prance. It’s to be entitled Temperance in\nWine Countries; and I’m sure you’ll agree that your unhappy\nnation certainly qualifies in that category.\nCertainly, sir, the wines of France are the pride and delight of\nthe civilized world.\nN0t in this quarter they’re not. The cases Ifve collected; you’d\nbe surprised. If the New York Temperance Society has its way;\n(and sooner or later it Will hava its way:) any kind of alchohol\nwill be totally prohibited in this State; and any where else we\ncan prohibit it.\nBut is not this an Intrusion on the individual? If you do not\nlike alcohol, well and good; but are all men to be forced to\nyour mould? On what grounds do you propose these extraordinary\nthings?"
