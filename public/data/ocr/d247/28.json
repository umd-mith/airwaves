I\nfeel rather strongly that, unless some good reason can be adduced\nfor having an outsider present during Harris' visit, far more can be\naccomplished by using local people. I would say that a principal of\na rural school who is really enthusiastic about what television has\ndone for his school, could do more for the cause than any of the\nexperts. I would, in fact, shoot for the \"consumer point-of-view on\nthe whole thing. The school principal, the teacher, the parent, the\nPTA member, civic leader, and then, of course, if you can get some¬\none just outside your coverage area who can testify that he, or she,\nhas had the opportunity to see some of these things and would like to\nknow if there isn't some way that you could get the full power so that\nhis community could have it regularly.\nI believe you have the golden opportunity, even if you have to bring\nyour people to Omaha to meet with Harris, because there is no\nquestion whatever in my mind that he is the key figure now in getting\nthe Bill through.\nGood luck^and God bless you.\n/j\nSincerely, //\n> ^\nR. F. Sehenkkan\nDirector\nRFS:eb\ncc: Bill Harley ‘\nHarry Skornia\nRalph Steetle"
