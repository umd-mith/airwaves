I tvs added your suggestion, re MMB possible\ndistribution of film and video tape, to agenda. With recent Ford\nefforts to shape United States education, I m pGroonaliy increasing¬\nly disinclined to let them (with money) tell all md sundry whet they\ncan and cannot do.\nA bit of discussion on this, by the Board, in relation to Herleyts\nreport on tha Learning mwmm* Destitute, etc. stsould be most\nhelpful, I be lie re.\nBut It would take quite a slug of money ibr us to do this. If you\nsay »no,» and want to kmp more informal, I can delete. It win be\nlast item on agenda.\nlest re garths.\nBarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nHJStlP\nCCt v Hr. William Earley"
