  "text": "NAEB Executive Committee\nFebruary 2, 1959\nPage two\nsome retirement equivalent. Then I could perhaps keep the University\nlectureship (I hope) which pays $2,200 of my salary, which would\nkeep me in the system as long as we!re in Urbana. If this is long\nenough, it is then possible that we might discuss with Journalism or\nWILL some consultant and other relationship which might extend through\nthe 10th year, to enable me to qualify after all.\nBut the latter is risky, and I would see no reason for the NAEB to\npour any more of its \"retirement\" funds for me into the university* s\nand State*s kettle from which I can*t get it unless 10 years of\nservice are achieved.\nOf course this \"10 years\" may be amended downward. If so, and if\nI stay in, this may change. It has already been changed to 10 frcm\nthe 15 years it was when I came.\nWe can discuss this later, of course, but this will answer the\nquestion.\nWe think, but are not yet officially sure, that the solution above\nsuggested will be possible. On the basis of what Frank Schooley\nhas been able to find out, we*11 probably not have to move out of\npresent quarters, even if only the Network revolving part of our\nbudget (some $35,000 to $40,000) is left in University hands. I\nthink we should leave this where it is, in that case, because of\nmany other considerations I won*t go into at the moment. It would\ngive us a home, probably at less than we could rent. And meanwhile,\nwith Headquarters not under the University, we*re already in a\nbetter position to consider next steps."
