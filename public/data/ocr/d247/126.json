Skomia\nExecutive Director, NAEB\nlii Gregory Hall\n(Jrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry t\nI am sorry to have gotten behind in ay correspondence\nsince returning from Columbus. Any reactions I might register\nat this late date to the several questions which you raised would\nprobably be an anticlimax, I do want to say \"amen*, however, to\nyour recommendation to hire Harold Stickle.)' as our new Editor. He\nsounds like a fortunate choice. The second \"amen” goes for your\nsuggestion to make a drive for sustaining memberships among our\nfriends in commercial radio. I don't see why it shouldn't work.\nI don't know too much about the operational expenses of the Hat-\nwork, but in these days of raising costs on evexything, it seems\nreasonable to raise the charge to $3.00. If an adjustment\nseemed advisable for network members, I should think it should\napply only to those who make full use of the network service.\nI need not tell you how over-joyed I was over the approval\nby the Title VII Advisory Committee of the Skomia-HcLuhan proj¬\nect. I hope we can have equally good success with another proj¬\nect before the September 1 deadline date is upon us.\nBy the way, the boys here are agreeable to my having the\nnext Bibliography on Radio and Television (copy enclosed) done\nunder contract. Presumably, I would have some supervision over\nthe final product, and I suspect it should be printed at GPO. I\ndon't know whether you have a competent staff assistant who could\nundertake the job, and thus be kept on your payroll during a\nslack season. Think about It and let me know.\nCordially,\n(Mrs.) Gertrude G. Broderick\nRadio-TV Education Specialist\ncc: Dr. William G. Harlqy\nGCBroderlekteaf"
