You are\nvery flattering and very kind, but I feei that much\nof the credit of the success of the meeting Is due\nto the headquarters s^aff. As I suggested in one\nof ray comments, the success of any board of directors\nis behaving like a board of directors Is directly\nproportioned to the quality of the staff work which\npreceeds the meeting. Harold Hill did much of the\nbasic preparatory work and this material was edited\nand amended by Harry. t*fhe result was that the board\nhad the basic information available upon which to\nbase '’yes’1 or \"no” decisions.\nIt is encouraging to note the progress the\nassociation is making and I hope the Detroit board\nmeeting will be able to receive reports of several\nmissions accomplished.\nCordially yours.\nWilliam G. Harle y\nWHi'Cp"
