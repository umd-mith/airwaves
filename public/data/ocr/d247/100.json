  "text": "-2-\nThe services provided by the Association are enumerated in the brochures\nsubmitted with th±3 request. However, the NAEB Radio Network deserves special\nexplanation* This Network distributes, by means of tape recording, approximately\n1000 hours of educational programing to member radio stations each year. This\nrequires the duplication of nearly 50,000 tapes annually*\nThe NAEB Radio Network was started on a limited basis as an exchange\neffort' of NAEB members in 1949 when a few programs a year were distributed to a\ndozen or so stations on a rotational, *bicycle” system whereby one station would\nbroadcast the programs, ship the tapes on to the next station, and so on* In\n1951 a grant was received from the W* K* Kellogg Foundation of Battle Creek,\nMichigan, which enabled the NAEB to establish an educational network for radio and\na permanent Association headquarters at the University of Illinois* This grant,\nwhich, enabled the Network to purchase mass duplicating equipment and to ship\ntapes to each individual station, provided fun support for the Network during\nthe first year of the grant, with gradually diminishing sums provided over the\nnext three years (during which period gradually increasing Network fees were\ncharged member stations using the Network) so that, by July 1, 1955, self-support\nfor the Network was attained, on a member-based annual network assessment basis*\nUnfortunately the budgets of most educational institutions for radio station\noperation in recent years have been so minimal that each effort to increase these\nfees enough to make possible the purchase of new equipment, or the meeting of\nother major expenses, has resulted in mere stations being forced to drop out* (See\nAppendix A, Table 1, attached*) Present annual assessments range from £300*00 to\n£800*00 per year, depending upon the power of the radio station using the network\nservice*\nThe two mass duplicators used by the Network were designed by Rawdon\nSmith Associates and manufactured by the L* S* Toogood Company* Each duplicator"
