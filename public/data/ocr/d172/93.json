Every phrase re¬\nappears many times.\nAs lessons proceed, the first tune is modified and adapted to fit new\nphrases. Frere Jacques, once learned, is used many times, since, with\nits repetitive phrasing, it allows the class to imitate what the radio\nteacher sings without upsetting the natural arrangement of the song.\nThe musical theme of the series, Au Clair de la Lune. is learned not\nfor the French phrases but because children like to be able to sing\ntheir radio program theme.\nDon't expect too much...of yourself, of all the boys and girls, of the\nseriesI The committee, however, feels confident you will be a little\nsurprised at the ease with which many of the young children learn French.\nAlthough this series is designed for grade 2, we leave it to the dis¬\ncretion of the teacher whether or not it may be used in other grades.\nWe have found that some first grades do very well, indeed.\nPlease feel free to write us your questions, criticism and comments.\nVISITONS MIMI is just a first step toward familiarity with the French\nlanguage and better understanding of the French people."
