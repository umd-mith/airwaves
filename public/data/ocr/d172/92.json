It is, of course, difficult to give\na true English equivalent for French sounds. In order to approximate sounds\npeculiar to the French language we have put some letters within parentheses,\nto be thought of but not pronounced.\nThe approach for this series is entirely aural. It is planned that no written\nFrench be used by the class* The handbook is for teachers only. It is NOT\nintended that word lists be presented to pupils before the broadcasts.\nA factor of prime importance is good reception. Because of the amount of\nparticipation involved, it is suggested that the pupils be seated in a group\nclose to the radio.\nHANDBOOK SYMBOLS\nWords in LIST 1 are the essential words to be learned by the class during\nthe lesson.\nWords in LIST 2 are supplementary* they are used in the lesson but are not\nemphasized at that point.\nPronunciation? Capitalized syllables are to be stressed slightly. Letters\nwithin parentheses are to be thought of but not pronounced.\nZH is to be pronounced like Z in ’‘azure”*\noo is to be pronounced by setting lips to say 00, at same time\nsaying ee."
