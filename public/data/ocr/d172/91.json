McGrath, who was until recently United States Commissioner\nof Education.\nuThe United States is, whether we like it or not, in a position of world\nleadership. If it is to discharge its responsibilities wisely and well, our\ncitizens must understand other peoples and other cultures. To gain such\nunderstanding many Americans must command a knowledge of other languages.\nIf they are to acquire these language skills, our school system must provide\nopportunity, beginning in the early grades, for many children to study other\ntongues.\"\nSubmitted by the Members of the Foreign Language\nRadio Planning Committee:\nMartha Casey, Bryan Hill, Chairman\nFrances N. Merwin, Stix\nCaroline Moreell, Beaumont High School\nSamuel Oliveri, Harris Teachers College\nRalph Perry, Harris Teachers College\nJuanita Randall, Michael\nRuth Stephens, Gundlach\nMost KSLH series are planned by Radio Planning Committees and are based on the\nCourses of Study of the St. Louis Public Schools. They are designated for\nspecific grade levels; however, this does not preclude their use in other\ngrades if they contribute something worthwhile to the listeners."
