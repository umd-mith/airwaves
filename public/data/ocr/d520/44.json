Y.\nMr. James Miles\nGregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Ill,\nDear Mr. Miles:\nCongratulations and hosannasl Your letter of July 29th concerning\nthe operation of the tape duplicator marks a milestone (and I am\nnot punning) in the history of educational broadcasting. Let’s\nhope all troubles are over and the Network can now begin to deliver\na service about which all of us have dreamed for a long time.\nThe response from the stations on the Jeffersonian Heritage is\nencouraging. Approximately 40 stations have indicated specific\nbroadcast schedules. What is of greater interest is that 39 com¬\nmercial stations have already written or called concerning the\navailability of the series - all as a result of stories like the\nenclosed.\nWe are looking into the possibility of having the Jefferson series\npressed by the same outfit that turned out THE PEOPLE ACT. We can\nhave approximately 100 LP sets of 7 records each at a cost of less\nthan $15. a set. Obviously, if we order additional quantities the\nunit cost will drop. If we received $20. or $25. a set from com¬\nmercial stations it would provide some slight income to NAEB even\nthough it would not in any manner attempt to recapture the total\ncost of production. I am, of course, basically interested in the\npressings as a means of promotion and it would have to be the\npromotional budget which would carry the initial costs. In other\nwords, a beautifully boxed album of pressings might be presented to\nthe President at the White House. I find it somewhat difficult\nto visualize a presentation of a series of tapes.\nWe will keep you informed of deve Dpments in\nSNS:LG\ncc: Messrs:Paulu,Hull,Schooley,\nProbst, Ausmus\n>ur N.\nPresident\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
