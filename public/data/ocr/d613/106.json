Use the fine stories the Lowell Institute provided, and adapt them\nto your own situation and news media. (Newspapers don’t like dittos - retype the\nwhole sheet - don’t just fill in the blanks.) Pull material from the brochures\nand work it into a couple of paragraphs for local release. (Have these men visited\nyou before? Do they have friends, relatives, former students on your campus?) By\ndoing so you help build an audience for your distinguished guests, your station\nand for your Association which makes these offerings possible.\nBill Bender, WUOM\n(for the Public Relations Policy Committee)"
