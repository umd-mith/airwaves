  "text": "X\nPREFACE\nIt has been said that a successful convention should have\nboth spirit and substance. The NAEB Region V meeting in Denver was\nindeed an effective blend of those ingredients. No written account\noan quite convey the spirit of lively, friendly discussion that prevails\nat any NAEB gathering. We feel somewhat more capable of communioating\nthe substance. The purpose of this report is to set down for interested\nreaders the sense of the talks and discussions at the two day meeting.\nThis report is not a transcript of proceedings. The major\ntalks as well as the comments, questions, and answers were reconstructed\nfrom the editor*s own notes taken at the meetings. Although original\nphraseology has been retained wherever possible, most of the remarks are\nparaphrased. Some errors of content, emphasis, or speaker identification\nmay have occurred. Certainly no calumny has been intended. The condensed\nversions of the four major addresses were submitted to the speakers for\ncorrection and were graciously approved.\nIt is our hope that the material included here will transmit\nto the reader the essence of enthusiastic, serious and informed thinking\nthat was general throughout the convention.\nGale R. Adkins"
