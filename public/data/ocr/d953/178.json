The\ntelegram should have been sent to you in Virginia even\nthough Terry insists that you \"aint receiving telegrams*’.\nThere is a majority vote for Harley, Merrill and Ludwig\nin that order. There is a minority vote for Dunn, Rish worth\nand Porter from Waldo Abbot. Allen Miller Joins with\nAbbot.\n1 have not heard from Dunn outside of his reaction to Wilbur's\nletter.\nSince there will not be a quorum at Abbs, it is not likely\nt at formal action can be taken by the Board. 1 m inclined\nto believe that we can reach the necessary conclusion by\nthe tine of lay return four weeks hence.\nmth best wishes.\nSKStLG\nSeymour N. Siegel"
