  "text": "Or. Marshall MeLuhan\nSeptember 18, 1959\nPage 2\n1 wonder whether we ought to concentrate on differences between\nthe media now rather than historical developments? X am not sure. It\nseems to me, however, that one must avoid trying to do everything so\nthat he winds up with a shallow report that adds nothing to knowledge.\nX would think that at this point the historical material is less useful\nto the point of the project — except in those cases where it definitely\nprovides clues to media differences today. It would be a mistake to\nworry too much at this point about the materials to be tested or the\npopulations on which to test them. X feel that one must define the hypo¬\ntheses to be tested.\nBest,\nResearch Committee\nSLBsnw\ncc: Dr. Harry Skornia"
