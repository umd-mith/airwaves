Burrows\nAssistant Director-Radio\nUniversity of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nDear Ed:\nJust a note to congratulate you on the letters to John Wiggin and Mr. Richard\nKimball. Efforts like these will, I'm sure, result in increased and better\nprogramming for the Network. I want to say again how much we appreciate\nthe way you have 4'taken hold4* of the Job of chairman of the Network Accept¬\nance Committee. Your efforts are the best we've had so far as I can recall.\nIt was good to see you in Chicago, and I think the committee did its usual\nfine job - and I was especially pleased at the amount of serious discussion\nand consideration that went into the selections. I was delighted that the\nmembers of the committee were willing to change their minds, both collective¬\nly and individually, in order to arrive at the best possible programming for\nthe Network, This doesn't mean, necessarily, that I would have voted the\nsame way, but that isn't the point I'm making.\nThanks for your help in Chicago. Your contributions were excellent, and I\nalso appreciate the things you had to say in connection with the forthcoming\nseminar in Madison.\nCordially,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nHEHiklp"
