The cliche that 70% are urban rests on the antiquated and\nmisleading assumption that any town of 2500 or over is ’’urban.’* Correcting\nthis to make 50,000 or over the urban base, together with the immediate\nsuburbs, we find that 46.5% of our people are really rural.* If the 1965\npopulation figures are corrected for this base, there are 88 million rural\nAmericans.\nOf that number, 22 million - one in four - are below the poverty level. **\nBroadly taken, this means poverty of all l^inds: hunger; bad housing; poor\nmedical care, or none; poor and abbreviated schooling.\nIn addition, the whole rural population is badly under-served by the\nimportant media of information and communications. The map of educational\nradio stations shows them concentrated in and around the great metropolitan\ncomplexes of the East and West Coasts and the Great Lakes cities. The\nimmense barrens of the Great Plains, from Alberta and Saskatchewan to\nMexicoJ Alaskai and a broad belt of the South, are totally without service\nfrom educational or public radio. State ETV systems in some States relieve\nthis drought for school children. But the rural adult is severely handi¬\ncapped by a meagre and impoverished^ press and a variety of useless com¬\nmercial radio stations - both of them cdpsule copies of the most inane\nfeatures of urban radio and press. These millions are, in short, utterly\nexcluded from the main stream of the National Conversation.\n*Based on Professor Harold Wblman’s article in the October 25, 1968, COMMONWEAL.\n**The People Left Behind, Report of the President’s National Advisory Committee*\non Rural Poverty. September, 1967."
