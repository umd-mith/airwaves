Frank Schooley, Treasurer\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nStation WILL\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Franks\nHerewith suggested space needs for NAEB. We8re dittoing so the rest of the\nBoard can see, also.\nIn addition to the problem of space there Is the fact that I have no office\nto which I can retreat to get work done. Every passer-by en route to the Network\nroom, passes my desk. A dozen or so inquiries a day reach us for Mr. Pe arson„\nThere are many Interruptions every hour. There is no place to dictate and I8ve\ngiven up trying to do this much. Personnel matters can not be discussed over the\nphone, because I9m surrounded by the whole Staff involved, etc. Therefore, not\nonly space but a certain number of enclosures are indicated in this statement.\nIt is assumed that the tape network could simply expand into present Head¬\nquarters space if Headquarters could find some, preferably nearby. If not, though\nit would not be good to have the two separated, it may mean a house, for Head¬\nquarters, although this would probably be less safe from a fire danger angle, for\narchives, than a University Building. In the FAE request draft I8ve mentioned a\nlikely 15,000.00 item. Imagine this should be a Kellogg item, but since I haven8t\nbeen drafting Kellogg request^ thought I5d ■ et it down somewhere, since the idea\nof trying to crowd more people into the present space and confusion situation\nmakes little sense. Here8 s what we have now.\n108\n14®\nHall /\n/\nAuditio\nRoom\nl\n338  36? .\nHeadquarters, plus desks for all j\nNAEB staff (Also office of Mr. S\nPeterson of Audio-Visual staff)\nTAPE NETWORK SPACE\n14°\n14®\n, Closet\n5®"
