If these plans can be made, I\nam very hopeful that I can (a) secure an audience with\nPresident Kennedy; (b) arrange for a luncheon to be\ngiven by the broadcast industry; or a luncheon spon¬\nsored by the Federal Communications Commission\nBar Association, of which I was formerly president,\nat which you and Mr. Rydebeck can speak. This\nluncheon would be attended by lawyers practicing in\nthe field of communication and government officials\nconcerned with the various aspects in the regularatory\nfield.\nWill you please give these matters some thought and\ndiscuss them with Mr. Rydebeck.\nI will be leaving Washington on July 1 for a six-weeks\ntrip to Japan. In the event it is not possible for you to\nsecure an answer before I leave, I have instructed my\noffice to forward the mail to me.\nIt is with deep regret that I missed the assembly\nmeeting in Brussels, but do look forward to attending\nRhCEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nJUiM 18 1962\nAM PM\nI"
