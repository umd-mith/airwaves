Griffiths\nFund for Adult Education\n1444 Wentworth Avenue\nPasadena 5, California\nDear Mr. Griffiths:\nAs in the case of the UAEB Engineer candidates, we found\nit impossible to secure applications for the position of\ndirector of our Placement Service without guaranteeing at\nleast a two-year contract. This we have done.\nIn view of this fact, it is our request and hope that\nthis FAE grant may be extended for a two-year minimum period,\nas assurance that the NAEB will have funds to continue this\nservice for at least that long, since this period is con¬\nsidered essential to get such a service adequately established\nthroughout the United States.\nWe shall be grateful for your consideration of this\nrequest at your convenience. Meanwhile, our most sincere\nappreciation for the service-coordinating steps which the\nFAE is making it possible for us to provide to the hundreds\nof persons and educational institutions in need of them.\nSincerely,\nHJS;wc\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director"
