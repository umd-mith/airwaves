There should, by then, be topics submitted by com¬\nmittee chairmen through their appointing authority, the President;\nby the NAEB officers; and by the Board itself. Some of the topics\ncould be disposed of on their own simple merit, as of little relevance\nto other NAEB activities. Others would likely receive a more judi¬\ncious appraisal in light of how they would affect other goals and\nobjectives of the organization.\nI would fully expect the referral of quite a few items to the\nappropriate NAEB committees for further study and recommendation to\nthe Board.\nI submit these suggestions seriously, but not presumptuously, as\none way we might attack the task we all agreed to do when we allowed\nourselves to be elected to membership on the Board. I hope they*re\nreceived in the way they*re intended -- as a simple tune-up to a\nbasically sound, well-designed and reliable old engine.\nIf you*ve managed to read this far, many thanks for \"hearing me\nout.\"\nSincerely\nKK:mm\nKen Kager, Chairman\nRadio Board\ncc: Dick Hull\nRay Hurlbert\nHarold Hill\n1 end: Illustrative List of Board Topics"
