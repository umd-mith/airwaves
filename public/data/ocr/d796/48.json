I FOUND YOUR LETTER OF\nJune 28th among the others awaiting my returs. I am\nHASTENING TO ANSWER IT BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF\nTHE SUGGESTION YOU HAVE MADE. YOU HAVE CERTAINLY PUT\nYOUR FINGER ON THE VERY VITAL AREA IN EDUCATIONAL\nBROADCASTING TODAY. I SUPPOSE THAT THIS PROBLEM IS\nSHARED BY ALL VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS. CERTAINLY IT\nHAS PLAGUEO NAEB FOR MANY YEARS. SlMPLY STATED, IT IS\nHOW DO WE MAKE PRACTICING DEMOCRACY WORK AT THIS LEVEL\nAHD HOW ARE WE CERTAIN THAT ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES\nALWAYS UNDERSTAND THE WISHED OF THOSE WHO ELECTED THEM,\nAND REFLECT THESE WISHES IN THEIR ACTIONS WITH THE\nGROUP.\nAs YOU KNOW NAEB HAS TRIED THROUGH THE YEARS\nTHROUGH NATIONAL PANELS AND GROUP D I SCUSSI0N8 AT THE\nIERT AND THROUGH THE GENERAL MEETINGS, AS WELL AS\nTHROUGH SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS AND OTHER AFFAIRS TO\nADEQUATELY AND ACCURATELY REFLECT THE THINKING OF ITS\nMEMBERS. IN SOME INSTANCES THIS HAS WORKED, AND WORKED\nWELL. IN OTHERS IT HAS BEEN WHOLLY INADEQUATE. I\nTHINK THE FACT THAT NAEB HAS PROSPERED AND GROWN IS\nSOME INDICATION THAT IT HAS BEEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE MORE\nTIMES THAN ON THE WRONG ONE.\nDiscussions regarding the programming of the\nNAEB RADIO NETWORK AND THE DECISION RECENTLY ARRIVED\nAT TO DO SOME EXPERIMENTAL WORK IN TV PRODUCTIONS HAVE\nBEEN THE RESULT OF MANY YEARS OF SOLID DISCUSSION. I\nBELIEVE THESE DECISIONS ARE NOW SOUND WITHIN THE FRAME¬\nWORK WE HAVE ESTABLISHED. As YOU ARE WELL AWARE THERE\nARE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS OF DOLLARS AND TIME INVOLVED\nHERE AND MANY OF THE THINGS WE WOULD LIKED TO HAVE DONE\nIN NAEB HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE OF ONE OR THE\nOTHER OF THESE LIMITATIONS."
