They put on an educational demonstration of its\nuses for me in Galveston. It ends all the objections\nwhich are currently being made about television in the\nclassroom. The teacher and the class have complete\nrapport. The students can use telephone or P.A. for\naudio intercom, but it is entirely misleading to use\nsuch an instrument merely in otfder to recreate the condi¬\ntions of the classroom, since it can do so many things\nthat the classroom could never do. Here is a unique case,\nhowever, of major technology getting a classroom tryout\nbefore a commercial one. In ordinary community use\nvideo telephone. In color, means a totally new era in\npackaging and shopping. In terms of management and deci¬\nsion-making all problems involving visual materials,\nlayout and design in publishing and in ad agency worlds\ncould be handled at very high speed and very low cost.\nHad my most profitable visit with Harold Wigren and\nwas amazed at the extent of his operation as Audio-Visual\nDirector of 184 Houston Schools. Most of my time, however,\nwas spent with Dick Evans who is a person of real calibre.\nI got to talk to their Psychology Dept, about various\naspects of media.\nEnclosed is my list of somewhat heavy expenses.\nPlease note that I paid for my air travel in Canadian\nfunds, an additional 5$,\nVery best regards."
