And it is the very structure of this all-at-once\ninclusive mode in teaching and learning which automatically ends\nwhat we till now called \"subjects.11 The electronic alters the\ncontours of math and physics and \"nature\" even as it abolishes\nliterature. The nature with which we will henceforth be engagee\nis one whose lines of force we will travel and explore with the\nsensitivity of the greatest artists. The split between art\nand nature ends now, as surely as the division between culture and\ncommerce. So far as the young are concerned, all these things are\nalready accomplished. Their sensibilities have been formed almost\nentirely and exclusively by electronic modes of experience. Even\nthe film, that last mechanical link with the Gutenberg era, they\nexperience mostly as translated through the medium of T.V.\nI put the matter this way in order to confront the education¬\nal points \"What is the difference between movie and T.V. after\nall?\" Just to heat up the issue a bit more, let me answer that\nthey have scarcely anything in common except the fact that both are\nvisible. The structure that is seen, however, is another matter.\nThe movie is a mechanical way of rolling up the world in a sequence\nof small still shots, not unlike the way in which print captures\nthe movements of an authorfs mind in a sequence of black and white\nstill shots. Played back, these still shots recreate or reconstruct\nan earlier action. The movie has built-in perspective and Is\nsuperb in details to fill in the pictorial space of its perspective.\nIn contrast, the T.V. image is a continuously formed mosaic with no\nstill shots, no reconstruction of actions, no perspective and very\nlittle detail. The T.V. mosaic is so poor in data, in fact, that it\nmust be mostly filled in by the viewer. And moreover it has no light\ncontinued."
