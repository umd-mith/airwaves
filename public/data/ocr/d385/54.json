It is true that\nshe requested an additional #200.00 some time during the course\nof her employment but at no time was this agreed on.\nTour client actually worked for a period of ten months\nand received twelve months1 salary. I am extremely doubtful\nwhether under the laws of Ontario, your client would be entitled\nto vacation pay but whether she is so entitled or not she has\nin effect had two months* vacation at full pay.\nIn conclusion, after examining this matter in some\ndetail 1 have advised Professor McLuhan that it is my opinion\nthat your client does not have any valid claim against either\nhim or the National Association of Educational Broadcasters.\nYours sincerely,\nmmm and brunt,\nPer:\nPSD*EC"
