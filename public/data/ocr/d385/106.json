M. McLuhan at\n29 Wells Hill Ave., Toronto 10, Ontario, have the\nnecessary papers to be filled out, it would be most\nappreciated.\nSincerely,\n(Miss) Ruth Nusbaum.\nThis is probably a hopdess question, but I shall ask\nit anyway. Prof. McLuhan did not keep his dinner\nand entertaining stubs^hile travelling for the NAEB.\nWould there be any way of accounting for the approx¬\nimate amount to be substantiated by the NAEB? I\npresume your regulations are like ours and the answer\nis no, but no harm in enquiring."
