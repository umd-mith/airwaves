It is typical of the\nway things happen that David Riesman should have urged me\nto contact him a few days ago, when I was in Cambridge,\nand when I got home his paper on communications and econom¬\nics had been sent on to me by Arthur Cole the Economist,\nquite independently of Riesman. I am to give a paper in\nSeptember, at the Annual Meeting of the Economic History\nGroup, on the media and economic development. ivy work\nwith the Electric Engineering Department is moving right\nalong. One major factor that they have ignored hitherto\nis that so-called information in any circuit is really an\nadditional medium rather~ than “content\". Even EleSTrlcaT^\nExiglxieei-js^rafPHe^lje^evilled by” older subliminal aspects\nof our culture. The fact that for thousands of years we\nhave put the medium of speech into the phonetic visual code\nhas blinded people to this as cause of our notion of\ncontent”. ..Forms like painting, music and even photography\n_are not thought of as containing anything, since there is\nonly one medium involved.\nThe Meier paper plays \"field” all the way making it\nvery simple to perceive how any medium new or old is\nnatural resource, as much as wood-or ~coai~br metal. And\na'R'TStAira^ a tapi^I^^OTtrTH^fT\"seen as ~a medium\nof communication . In a word, media and staples alike be¬\ncome basic configurations imposing their own patterns and\nassumptions on all who are concerned with them."
