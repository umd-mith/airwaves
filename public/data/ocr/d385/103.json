Their opinion was that money\npaid to me by the NAEB would not be taxable,\nsince it was from an educational source and paid\nto an educator on-leave-of-absence, and to one\nwho was engaged in educational research. If this\nshould be their final interpretation it will save\nme upwards of $1,000, so here*s hoping.\nYou might mention to me, Harold, whether a\nsimilar ruling applies to American Taxation of\neducational grants.\nSpring seems finally to have mosied up this\nway, but without any very definite intentions.\nMost cordial regards, _ Q\nHMM/KN\nEnclosure."
