Z really wanted singly to know whether\nyou know yet what the financial situation will be next year. Do you\nknow yet, at least whether money will be available to continue the\ngrants-in-aid? Zf so, how much?\nZ do not know how many of the comnittee will be present at\nColumbus. Z hope the majority. 1 assume that there are no funds\navailable to help get them there? nils would be no problem for me\nif Z could get away from here but Z know that it is a problem for\nsom. Zs there any way to help foot the bill for som of them —\nespecially the non-HAEBers and perhaps those who live som distance\nfrom Columbus — say Cheydleur and Harwood? (Z am not hopeful on this\nbut thought Z had better at least pose the question.)\nI would like to write the comnittee as soon as possible on an\nagenda for the Columbus Meting. Would like to hear from you first,\nhowever, so 1 hope that you will have time for a short note on the\nMjor points above.\nBest,\nSam L.
