Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film\nState University of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam:\nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nStation KUOM\nUniversity of Minnesota\nMinneapolis 14, Minnesota\nJanuary 2, 1958\nI speak for headquarters as well as for myself when I express\ngratitude for your willingness to accept the post of chairman of the\nNAEB Research Committee. This is an area in which NAEB has been doing\nmore and more lately. Bob Coleman gave this committee a lot of time\nand thought several years ago. Ray Cheydleur did yeoman service last\nyear.\nNow—with Ray's full approval—we are handing this over to you.\nRay is continuing on the committee, however, and that is good, since\nit will give us continuity. Besides, he can help in concluding some\nof the activities currently in progress. In fact, you may want to\nset up an occasional subcommittee with Ray at its head to wind up\nsuch projects as are in midstream. For your information, a list of\nfull membership for 1958 is attached. As you know, we have tossed\naround by mail-and telephone the question of whether to enlarge the\ncommittee by including some \"name\" people from outside our ranks.\nAfter giving this much careful consideration, I've decided against\nit. We've found that committees become unwieldy if too large, and\nfurthermore that the costs of meeting become excessive. But, there\nis nothing to prevent our setting up an \"advisory council,\" or some\nsuch thing whenever we want to; then we could bring in Foshay,\nLazarsfeld, Nielsen, Hooper, Dick Nixon, et alii.\nThe Research Seminar held at Columbus (which other NAEB duties\nunfortunately prevented my attending) made a strong recommendation\nfor a full-time research director. This suggestion surely meets with\nmy approval, and I Imagine gets Harry's okay as well. I shall include\nthis among the items on the agenda of the Foundation Committee, which\nwill be meeting within the next few weeks. If put into effect, I\npresume it would require funds additional to those now available to us.\nWelcome to the ranks of NAEB committee chairmen. And power to\nyou in your new position!\nWith best regards for a Happy New Year,\nYours sincerely,\n4 Burton Paulu\nBPjds President\ncc: Harry Skornia, Jack McBride,\nRay Cheydleur, Bob Coleman"
