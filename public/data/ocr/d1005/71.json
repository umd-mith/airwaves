John M, Parsey\nResearch Director\nNational Project In Agricultural\nCommunications\nMichigan State University\nEast Lansing, Michigan\nDear Johns\nSorry to be so long in responding to your letter after\nthe Columbus seminar but 1 was looking for a graduate student\nor two here whom I thought were capable of carrying on such\na project with a minimum of supervision from me. (Sorry to\ntell you that there are darned few of such animals around.)\nAnyway, I gave tip the search when X received the news that\nKen Harwood will be doing It. Think this is fine.

This is often helpful to future researchers in tele*\nvision end other media, aa well es in radio. (2) X would ilka\nto see an evaluation of the studies covered, rather than simply\na description. As you know, there has been some abominable work\ncarried out in the name of broadcast research (X have even done\nsome of it myself!) and X believe the compiler of such an lnven*\ntory has a responsibility to tha reader to be extremely critical\nand honest. This is important for researchers who are to use\nthis inventory as a reference. This is probably more important\nfor the practitioner. The researcher, if some of the studies\nare relevant to his work, will go to the basic documents and"
