The merits of television, like the merits\nof any other instrument, lie in what it can do best for\nwhich student and under what circumstances.\n(6) We must make available to our \"self-educators\" a rich\nrepertory of resources. Opportunities for learning many\nthings, at many levels, in many ways, at many times. As\nonly one of these resources, television does not replace\nbut significantly can reinforce the effectiveness of other\ninstruments of learning.\n(7) Bacause learning takes place within the learner, and not on\nthe television screen, television is at its best when it\noreates opportunities which will invite and stimulate\nviewers to learn, which will arouse interest, excite\ncuriosity, and impel pupils toward constructive activity."
