I trust this action on my part, along with all my other\nactivities for NAEB, will be interpreted only as it is intended, namely of working\nfor a ’’merger of interests’1 for the greatest utilization of television for educa¬\ntion. I stand ready now, as I always have, to work for a mutual agreement that\nwill not only save educational television, but work for a stronger position.\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nNovember 17, 1955\nFES:wc"
