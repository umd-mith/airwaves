Amoilg other things this company has\ninstalled a five inch black and white electronic viewfinder in their cameras* Their\ncameras have a four lens turret. They have both the portable and studio control\nunits available, and their cameras appear to be ruggedly constructed from a\nmechanical standpoint. The same vidicon pick-up unit, that is vidicon tuba and\ndeflection coils only, could be purchased for use as the film pick-up device. For\nan additional expenditure, this same vidicon and deflection coil could foe installed\nin a studio camera housing for live camera pick-up.\nSarkes - Taraianalso demonstrated a live vidicon pick-up camera, which had\na five inch viewfinder similar to the Kay Lab, but it had only three lenses on its\nturret.\nThe Dage Company, of course, demonstrated their live camera pick-up\nunit, which lias not changed in its specifications appreciably from previous years.\nIt still contains a green three inch viewfinder and retains the same over-all\ndimensions. However, the Date Company demonstrated a rather simple remote\ncontrol unit for the vidicon camera which allowed the operator to pan, tilt, change\nlenses, and focus from a remote situation.\nMany of the companies demonstrated film pick-up devices using vidicon.\nThe Dage Company, of course, demonstrated that their normal studio cameras\ncould be fed with film. However, they also had a newly 'designed vidicon film\npick-up unit which could be expanded to include 3-V £oior picfe-upi '."
