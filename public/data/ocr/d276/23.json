Commission\nis obtaining information on possibility of improving sensitivity of UHF receivers and\nliming mechanism* “This was authorised to an effort to explore the practical\npossibilities of making UHF and VHF comparable* This rule making proceeding\nwill offer industry the opportunity to provide practical assistance. These\nproposals, if successful, offer a potentially more efficient use of the authorised\nspectrum space\", he stated*\nRespectfully submitted by\nNAEB Engineering Committee\nJohn Brugger\nKobt* Higgy\nBerten Hoimberg\nKeith Ketcham\nEdw* Kratt\nC.
