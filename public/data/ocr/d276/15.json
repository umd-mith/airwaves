It was shown and demonstrated\nat the NARTB equipment exhibit and this 1 Multicasting ” equipment is described in\nthis report*\nBy the use of multiplex equipment it is possible to use an FM transmitter\nfor broadcasting the regular program on the assigned frequency and at the same\ntime broadcast one or more other, and differing programs from the same\ntransmitter „ This is accomplished by super \"imposing one or more FM subcarriers\non the main carrier of the FM station* A special multiplex modulator unit must be\ninstalled at the transmitter for each multiplexed subcarrier* hi operation, the main\ncarrier (or regular program service) is received as before* However, it is\nnecessary to use a special adaptor with each receiver to ree tai ve the multiplexed\nsubcarrier* At present, using the main carrier channel and one multiplexed channel,\nit is possible to transmit an audio frequency range of 50 - 15000 cycles per second\non each channel. If more than one multiplexed subcarrier channel is used, the\naudio frequency range is limited to 50 - 8500 cyics par second*\nNAEB members may be interested hi this system if they are close enough\nto form a local network* In such an application the main carrier would be used for\nregular broadcasting and the subcarrier used as a relay transmission link.
