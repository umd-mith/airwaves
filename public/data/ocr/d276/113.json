Formats The format visualized is a combinatioa of drama^ocumsntary-actuality-\ninterview techniques as needed for a series of radio programs of from thirteen\nto perhaps sixteen one hour or half hour programs, preferably the former. Both\nthe number and length of programs are subject to change as the plans far the\nseries proceed.\n4* Distributions In view of the growing problem of the aged in foreign lands, and\nthe extent to which these lands have looked particularly to England for guidance\nin solving this problem, it is believed that a significant foreign use would be\npossible for this series if a straightforward approach is used, and \"tricky11\nproduction is avoided. This secondary use should be kept in mind in the selec¬\ntion of personal, social, economic and industrial examples for the series. Uni¬\nversality should be emphasized in all planning and writing. Foreign experts,\nserving as consultants, checking scripts in advance, will help insure wise plan¬\nning in this regard.\nFinally, it is our hope and belief that all or part of these programs might\nalso be made into television kinescopes or films for the last step in the full\nuse which should be visualized for this project.\n5. Budget Suggested for.. thia..sarleg:\nFor general planning, writing and radio\nproduction as outlined above at an esti¬\nmated $2,000 per program (plus $1,000 for\ngeneral planning) $27,000.00\nFor coordinator, promotion and contingencies 5,000.00\nTOTAL (Estimated) $32,000.00\nThe above budget does not include publication or recordings, both of which\nshould be at least self-supporting. It will undoubtedly need to be revised as\nplanning proceeds."
