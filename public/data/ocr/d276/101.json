The three\nseries proposed here are all therefore in a sense functions of each other and very\nclosely related.\nNAEB members have already done a certain amount of work in this area. The\n'♦permissive interviews” and clinical recordings done by Parker Wheatley and the\nLowell Institute Cooperative Broadcasting Councils A LONG LIFE and WE HOMAN BEINGS\nrevealed seme of the possibilities of radio in this area. These were some of the\nearliest programs on the NAEB Radio Network.\nThere havs been later efforts in this direction by other NAEB stations as\nwell. One of those which might best suggest the format and technique visualized\nfor this series was done a few years ago by the University of Minnesota’s Station\nKUOMi STATION SIXTY. This program won many awards and is still frequently re¬\nquested by responsible and interested groups.\nHowever, most of our member stations have not, without financial assistance,\nbeen able to devote the time, personnel and budget to this area which it^deserves.\nFor such programs require a great deal of each.\nRadio will still offer many advantages over television in this type of\nproject, particularly in the extent to which it makes possible the preservation\nof the anonymity of persons interviewed. Also visual realism in clinical sit¬\nuations which would be used are sometimes far more unpleasant than only aural\nrecordings with the tape editing and simple montage effects which can be provided in\norder to convey some of the types of disturbance and treatment with which the series\nwould deal. In all cases great care must of course be preserved to insure against"
