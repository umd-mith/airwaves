Just as it has\nbeen already here in Wisconsin* We respectfully urge that your rules and\npolicies be relaxed to peradt educational and public service agencies to pro¬\nvide their own microwave relay service where needed to help in the realisation\nof the great educational potential of television*\nVery truly yours.\nee ICC Members\nH« B.
