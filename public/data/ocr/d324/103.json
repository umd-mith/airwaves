C.\nDear Leonard:\nThe attached letter, received by Frank Schooley here, was\ngiven me in case it is felt that the NAEB might wish to voice\nan opinion. Frank tells me that the University will not. I\nhave sent a copy of it to Cecil Bidlack to get his point of\nview as an engineer. Meanwhile, do you think that, as the pro¬\nfessional association of educational broadcasters, we should\nfile a brief?\nWill hope that you will be attending our New York Conven¬\ntion.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nHJSscp\nEnclosure"
