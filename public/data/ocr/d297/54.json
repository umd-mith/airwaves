Skornia\nNAEB Headquarters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry: ^\nRelative to the Smathers Bill:\nIf the Smathers Bill actually would prohibit a university\nwhich publishes music or sells recordings of musical\ncompositions from licensing a television station, then we\nought to do something about it—and inform Garrison and\ncompany that we are!\nThe question is just what should we do? We don't want\nto put ourselves in the position of pulling BMI's chestnuts\nout of the fire! That, undoubtedly, is what they intended\nin bringing this up with Marks.\nIf the bill as it presently stands actually would\nprohibit the University of Michigan from publishing music\nand licensing a station, wouldn't it be possible to somehow\namend the bill so as to exclude educational organizations?\nThis would protect the rights of educational institutions\nwithout embroiling us in the whole to-do between music\npublishers and broadcasters.\nOnly as the last resort, in my opinion, should we\nactually oppose the bill as such; this is not basically our\nfight; and, we don't want to be pulling the chestnuts out of\nthe fire for any of the commercial boys. (If this can be\ndone without appearing to testify, so much the better,\nsince it is easier and cheaper.)\nYours sincerely,\nBurton Paulu\nPresident\nBP:ds\np. S. So, would you get in touch with Dobin, and keep me\ninformed on developments?"
