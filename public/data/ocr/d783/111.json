We would appreciate it if you would indicate\nin the financial statement what the balance was and how\nmuch will have to be found to complete the payment for\nthe 3,000 reels.\nWe certainly enjoyed having you fellows with us a\nfew days ago. The report is really quite impressive\nin spite of all the handicaps we have had.\nWe are in the midst of project reports and budget\nhearings clear up to our ears. It was fortunate we found\nthe time we did for you to come. Otherwise, I am afraid\nit would be impossible after that date. I hope your work¬\nshop proves to be even more successful than you anticipated.\nSincerely,\nRobert VanDuyn\nRVD:hmn"
