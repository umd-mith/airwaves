Harley\nFrom:\nVernon Bronson\nDiscussion with selected persons at Region meeting\non Use of Satellites for Educational Communications.\n1. The attached notes are culled from most of the latest papers on this subject.\nThey point out possible techniques, some problems in standards and time differ¬\nences, economic problems, various kinds of satellites and of orbits, international\nproblems, and up-coming projects.\n2. We would like some ideas or suggestions cn the following:\n(a) Is the use of satellites for trans-continental or inter-continental edu¬\ncational communications feasible?\n(b) What possible uses? Cheap net-working? General direct broadcast?\nInter-institutional data transmission on an international basis?\nSharing of complicated technology such as multiple use of sophisti¬\ncated computer systems ? Other ?\n(c) Should specific frequencies be reserved for education ?\n(d) If so, what areas of the spectrum and how many?\n(e) What is best domestic agency to control space communications as far\nas education is concerned? NASA? FCC? Joint international?\nOther ?\n(f) What demand should education make for representation in forth-coming\nconferences and negotiations for allocations of frequencies for\nsatellites ?\n(g) Will reservations or allocations made now set the pattern for the next\nthree decades, or will multiple use of single frequencies techniques\nand optical masers make presently contemplated use of frequencies\nobsolete ?\nmmpmrn"
