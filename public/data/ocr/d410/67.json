The first one is the intro¬\nductory ” bird*s eye view of the situation” and I think can easily\nbe re-recorded. 1*11 change a topical item or two, and also provide\na Reading List of half a dozen good books on Japan. Therefore, if\nyou haven*t started sending out the tapes, please hold off until\nI can go over this one which will be next week.\nThis Saturday May 12, I will record programs V and\nVI ancf as soon as the scripts are mimeographed will send along.\nBy the way, since I have changed theme music, etc. I think Program\nNo. I will shape up into something quite good.\nA letter dated May 3 from Seymour Siegel informs me that\nhe looks forward to the series, and I hope you will send No. 4 as\nthe latest and best sample. By the way, John Holt advised me the\nweek he left that he was sending me some tapes to listen to which\nhave not arrived, hence I am going to be out of tapes soon. Would\nyou kindly send another 6. I don*t know if you want the scripts or\nnot, but I think it might be a good idea for you to have them for\nreference. I write a ” shooting script 11 which I take into the studio\nwith guest, etc. And when the program is recorded, make the changes\nand give it to mimeograph. Unfortunately it takes about 2 weeks to\nget them back. Please let me hear soon again. JOHN LERCH"
