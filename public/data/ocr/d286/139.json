This will\ninvolve the close cooperation of several teacher-training insti¬\ntutions of the United States, and will cover both production and\nutilization aspects of these media.\nIt will involve bringing together the skills of communications\nand content area experts with those of experts in teaching pro¬\ncedure and educational philosophy. The end-product of such a\nproject will be sound courses and curricula in this area# eventually\nIn all or nearly all of the schools of education and teachers\ncolleges of the nation. This need is of great urgency in view of\nthe many educationally irresponsible uses being urged (which\nwould in many cases only make education cheaper rather than\nbetter and richer) and the trial and error procedures which now so\nlargely prevail as definitions of the educational roles of television"
