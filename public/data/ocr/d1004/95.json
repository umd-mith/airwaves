I, too,\nbelieve that this can be an Important year for the\nResearch Committee. Just hope that we can get things\nstarted so that the organisation will be headed in the\nright direction, research-wise.\nConcerning your questions and comments about\nthe radio Inventory project — this came along at a\ngood moment. If this cooperative project has not gone\nthrough, I believe it would have been one of the first\nmajor projects for the research committee — which we\nwould have had to finance alone. One of the problems\nwith the NAEB committee structure — members scattered\nacross the country — is that it is impossible to poll\nthe committee when decisions must be made quickly. I\nassume that this is what happened with this one. As for\nthe source of the funds, this I do not know.\nThank you again for the letter. Looking forward\nto some good suggestions from you for our research plans.\nSincerely,\nSam L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film"
