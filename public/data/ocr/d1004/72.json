Aa 1 say, this Is tough. The analysts nust know\ntheir business. Also, one does not stake many friends this\nway among those whose studies you are reviewing. On the other\nhand, if this is not done, the value of the Inventory Is\nseverely limited. This wes the major fault with Kunata's\ninitial inventory of Instructional television research.\nAgain, let me apologise for the delay In responding\nto your first letter. It was certainly not due to a lack of\ninterest on mgr part in this project. X believe it to be\nextremely important. I look forward to hearing of its progress.\nIf there is anything that X can do, plaase feel free to write.\nThere will be no similar delay the next time.\nSincerely,\nSam L.
