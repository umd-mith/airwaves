  "text": "15.\nIV. Surveys #1 and #2 reflected a decrease from 1% to 11# in the\nobjection to the conducting of the survey. On Survey #3 it dropped\nfurther to 7#*\nFrom these conclusions several generalizations might be made. It\nseems safe to say that a change from carrier current to M and PH will\nincrease community listenership. Those members of the audience who listen\nto EH will continue to do so. The increase of TV set ownership seems\nto have little effect on the radio listening pattern. Although, there\nmay be a slight objection on the part of seme respondents to a survey\nof this type, those objections will decrease with repeated contact or an\nincrease of favorable disposition toward the University*s radio station.\nThe change from a limited to a full time operation has not changed the basic\npolicies of a student operated station. Reports of student reception\nindicate a complete coverage of all student living units, both on and off\ncampus. The expendature of $12,000 for AM seems to be justified*"
