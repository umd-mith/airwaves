The reader has no way of knowing which dif¬\nferences might he attributable to chance.\nThis study has some interesting implications for educa¬\ntional institutions with FM stations or wired-wireless stations.\nX would certainly urge that you whip it into shape and send\nit off to the NAEB Journal editor. X assume that the NAEB\nwill be given proper credit when it is published, e.g., \"Sup¬\nported in part by a grant from the National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters•”\nGood luck with the rewrite.\nSincerely,\nSam L.
