Skornia\nExecutive Director\nNAEB\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nRegarding your letter of January 28th.\n1) 1 think it extremely important for the NAEB to be a member\nand support the International Association for Mass Communi¬\ncation Research, there are many reasons for this:\ns) It is important for us to be recognised as the\nrepresentative of educational broadcasting in\nthis country.\nb) Xt is important for us to support groups with\nInterests which coincide with ours and out of which\ncan come information which is important to educational\nbroadcasting. If we do not join, most of the push\nfrom this country will apparently be in the direction\nof journalism-type research and this is only one small\npart of what it should be.\n2) Oa the Nielsen proposal, X would certainly wait for next year,\nX also wonder about the advisability of going through with\nthis against some rather strong opposition. Most of the sta¬\ntion managers, as it is, see little value for them in research.\nX am afraid their opposition to research might become even\nstronger if, at this time, something is done which they feel\nmight be destructive of their Interests or position. As X\nsee it, the issue is not important enough at this time to risk\nalienating the station managers.\n3) think the plan to cooperate with the NPAC and EIRC on the\ncosgtilatlon and analysis of radio research is wise indeed.\nX assume that you received Cheydleur's letter of the 29th\nconcerning the issuance of certificates to those who attended the\nresearch seminar, X do not know the shape of the budget but there\nseem to me to be many more Important places where this money could\nbe put. However, if you think it wise, I would not argue against\nCordially,\nSLB:\nSam L. Becker"
