In this encounter at least, they did not\nuse guns or clubs# But they finally had to call up a fire engine\nwith a big hose running the length of a water tank on top of it#\nThen something happened that was real Italian opera buff a# Something\nwas wrong with the power system on the truck# And Instead of playing\na powerful stream of water down the Condotti, the hose sent only\na pitiful drlszile some ten feet toward the students#\nAt that point the spectators, standing on the Spanish steps.\nJoined the students in shouts of derision, while three riot squad\nmm worked feverishly to get the hose in working order. At last\nthe workmen succeeded in getting the power up and, turn played the\nhose down the Condotti and dispersed the students, though many of\nthem tool refuge in office building entrances and continued to lean\nout and wave drenched Italian flags and shout defiance*\nfou can see why I say that the demonstrations did have their\nlighter side* They also had their grim side* The correspondent\nof an Austrian newspaper had his Britiobwaade automobile burned up\n— totally ruined — on one street* A university of Minnesota\nprofessor, T:r. Alan Tate, van roughly handled and his car damaged\nby angry students until friendly older Italians came to his rescue*\nThe crowd mm smashed in windows at the Anglo-American hotel in\ndowntown Home# And, as you may have read, the riot squads had to\nuse tear gas as well as water to disperse the mob in front of the\nAmerican embassy#"
