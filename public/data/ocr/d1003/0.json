Jim Miles\nGentXarasm\nAttached please find a copy of a recent letter from Jim IfcPhsrson of the DAVI, which\nformally requests NAEB to perform certain services for them® 1 am sending this letter\nat this tin® to explain the circumstances which preceded MbFhari'on's latter and to\ngive soma reasons why I believe we should cooperate with them*, r. would also like to\nrequest that it be mad© an item for ths agenda of the board rcaeti\\g in Minneapolis*\nI have a basic belief that the increased us© of audio material, whether It comes\nthrough a radio loud-speaker or a tap© machine loud-speaker, will rewound to the\nbenefit of all those interested in educational broadcasting. I further believe that\na majority of our school stations and some of the college stations grev out of the\ninterest of m individual who had access to more material than he could us© through\nhis normal channels of distribution and who thus became interested in the possibilities\nof FM broadcasting. For these two basic reasons, I think we should do anything, we\ncan to encourage such use of audio material*\nTape recorders are becoming quite consnonplace in our public schools* There si* 11\nare only about one-tenth as many tepe recorders as 16 E&XXimeter sound motion picture\nprojectors, but the nun&er is growing and will grow more if a good source of mater: el\n*to play on those recorders is assured*\nThe state audio-visual groups have long realised this, and many of them are atton^tix%\nto set up a tape recording library* patterned after the one pioneered by Kxnnssotao\nAt the July meeting to which MsPherson refers about fifteen states had such state\nlibrary plans in various stages of development and operation# These libraries are\nbeing added to at the rate of six hundred to nine hundred reels of tape per year*\nOr maybe I should say they would be added to at this rata if they could have a ready\nsource of program material to buy or record©\nThey have discussed many proposals for reseting this need* They have committees work¬\ning on some sort of a central office with duplicating facilities such as we have#\nThis, of course, will take money and so they are* readying proposals to foundations\nand exploring other means of financing* In the meantime, they need to make soi.se\nsort of a trial run*\nHers is where NAEB fits in* We can readily duplicate on our mass duplicator copies\nof programs selected by them* I believe we can do so at a price which will not\ngreatly exceed their individual tape purchase price at the local level* We will be\ninvolved only in bulk handling of tapes and will only be involved finance-wise with on©\ngroup*\nIt is rry thought that not more than twenty-two orders for these tapes will be received#\nThis is true inasmuch .as orders will fea accepted only from state «wido organisations\nwhich want them for redubbing purposes# Thus, at the most wawmld be involved in\nabout 2$Q run-throughs on th© duplicator* At three run-throughs an hour, this means\nabout eighty-five hours of work* This, of course, would be done outside of regular\noffice hours and would in no way interfere with the operation of the network© This\n’group has moved very slowly on these matters in the past, and, banco, more than likely\nwill not ba raa<^r to submit anything to ns for duplication in less than six months\ntime©"
