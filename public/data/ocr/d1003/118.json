Our material then would be available to radio stations through\nNAEB; available to classrooms through the Tape Repository.\nI would appreciate a reply as soon as possible since we are now\ntrying to process the new National Catalog.\nSincerely yours.\nChairman, Radio-Recording Committee\nDAVI\nRECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nMAY 2 1955\n»M P*\ni\nrh:ow"
