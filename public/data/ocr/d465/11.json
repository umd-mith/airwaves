Originally, I was\nthinking of a proposal dealing with a summer activity here at KTCA-TV.\nHowever, in my reply I had intended to include the information about\nthe N.A.E.B. Utilization Kit Proposal. After working on the draft of\nthis letter to McPherson, I thought I had better check with you before\nsending any information to him. Perhaps you have better channels to\nthe U.S. Office of Education than this. It might be inappropriate to\nsend any information other than what might come from Headquarters • I\nwill hold this letter to McPherson until I hear from you.\nR* Tettemer, Sr.\nDirector of School Programs\n(\nand Research\nCRT/gvn"
