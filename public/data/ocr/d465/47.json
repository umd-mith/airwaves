Now that I have taken care of the\nrequest let me say it was a real pleasure to talk\nwith you again. Perhaps we will have the opportunity\nto work together some day.\nLee has told me how well you all treated him\nAiring his visit to the University. I*m sorry I\ndid not have the chance to sit down and look at\nthe entire series. Since I was trying to accomplish\na great many things in a few days this was one of\nthe pleasures I had to give up. I would like to have\na complete outline of the series if one is available,\nI*m sure that a final report will be issued and if\nyou are making a list of \"report moochers\" tack my\nname onto the bottom.\nAs I understand the lineup, 36, 37 and 38 deal\nwith radio and television. As you know, we are sur¬\nveying the field of available material to go along\nwith our utilisation informational kits. If there\nare any other programs in this series that you think\nhave some bearing on our work, I would appreciate\nyour setting them up for our previewing. I will be\nable to use the films whenever they are available and\nwill undertake to return them immediately.\nCordially,\nCRT/gvc\nc.c. Harold Hill\nClair R. Tettemer\nDirector of School Programs"
