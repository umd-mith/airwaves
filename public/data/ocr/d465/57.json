  "text": "Materials and places where materials could be developed would\nbe located through correspondence and personal visits. Following the\ninitial contact and expression of interest, outlines of proposed in¬\nformation kits would be developed. These outlines with examples of\nexisting materials would be evaluated by the NAEB Utilization Committee.\nThis evaluation would take place at a meeting of the Committee held in\nconjunction with the NAEB 1960 Convention in San Francisco. A budget\nfor this phase is attached.\nPHASE 2 - Development\nFollowing the evaluation meeting specific production plans would\nbe worked out with organizations or individuals. A budget for this phas\nwill be developed and submitted after the plans are known. This budget\nwill be broken down into sections covering the production of each indi¬\nvidual kit.\nPHASE 3 - Production\nEach producing agency would be responsible for meeting certain\ndeadlines and standards of production. The budget for this phase would\nbe a part of that developed in Phase 2. The completed kits would be re¬\nviewed by the Utilization Committee before being released for distribu¬\ntion.\nPHASE 4 - Distribution\nMaterials would be distributed from NAEB Headquarters for short\nterm loan. Specific plans for distribution would be drawn up after the\nnature of the material is known. The only budget item related to this\nphase would be the duplication of the material in sufficient copies to\nserve the requests.\nIV. Approximate Time Schedule;\nJuly 1, 1960 Project starting date.\nNovember 1, 1960 Completion date for Phase 1.\nJanuary 1, 1961 Completion date for Phase 2.\nApril 1, 1961 Completion date for kit production\nMay 15, 1961 Completion of Phases 3 and 4.\nJune 30, 1961 Final report completed."
