Erana\n5006 Wlckett Terrace\nBethesda, Maryland\nDear Miss Erana:\nIn answer to your letter of November 3 I am enclosing a complete set of\nFact Sheet Series I which deals primarily with television as a teaching\ntool, and also a Fact Sheet Index.\nWhen you look through the Index, you will note that there are other Fact\nSheets in different series which touch on television in classrooms and so\nforth. If you desire a copy of any of these, please let me know by giving\nme the Series number and copy number. The price is ten cents per copy.\nFor the enclosed set, we did not charge you the usual rate, but will instead\nexpect your remittance of $2.50 (a savings of eighty cents). This discount\nis due to the fact that we hope to incorporate the Fact Sheets into the NAEB\nJournal in the near future and will therefore not wish to keep too plentiful\na supply of the mimeographed Fact Sheets cm hand. If you wish to send\nyour remittance by check, please make it out to the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\nOF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTERS.\nI have forwarded your letter on to another department where I am sure your\nrequest for a copy of the January AERT Journal will be taken care of immedi¬\nately. If I can be of further service to you, please let me know.\nSincerely,\n(Mrs.) Judith B. Gans\nSecretary\nEnclosures (2)\nblcc: F.Hartz\nH.Hill (FYI)"
