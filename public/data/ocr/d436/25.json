However, at the recent Urbana\nmeeting I got the idea that there were 28. Can you give me the final wprcL - fi\non this? — /‘j’TAvC XHUyJ AtJt', IbtjLvJ jw^uLl^L Vfc /0 Xu.\ni _ %-pLr > iti*. ^ 1 b\nIf there are li; programs in the series, by the way, the figures I sent you yes¬\nterday are slightly off. The total charge for all the currently-being-processed\nin-school programs is $176 at $2.00 per reel. This hardly changes the per pro¬\ngrams costs. The figures given were not 100$ accurate, but they were quite close.\nI*m sorry I won*t be able to be at the Regional meeting — especially after having\nenjoyed the last one I attended so much and after having repeatedly said that I\nthought it was perhaps even more important that I go to more Regionals than to\nNationals. But that*s the day before I get married. Well, one way or another, 1*11\nget a change of pace, I guess}\nM\nSincerely,\n4iU\nj/hn Holt\nRECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nMAR 11 1955\nNetwork Manager^^^\nJH:cr"
