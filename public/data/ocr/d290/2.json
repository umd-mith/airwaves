Burrows\nManager, mm\nAdministration Binding\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nBear 0d:\nI think your plans for a meeting to consider music programming on\neducational stations is excellent.\nt don’t know, at this time, of any other meetings which might tend to\nconflict with your scheduled dates of November 6-7. I hope that\nyour meeting can also consider the matter of musical programs on the\nNAKB network and how more, and better ones, might be obtained.\nIncidentally, if ycm don’t hear from Jim (at least personally) for\nsome time, it’s because he left last week for a vacation of several\nweeks.\nBegards,\nBaroM £« Hill\nVice President\nHSK/mlm"
