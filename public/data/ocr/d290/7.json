Burrows, Manager\nThe University of Michigan • Ann Arbor, Michigan\nWUOM 91.7 me.\nANN ARBOR\nWVGR 104.1 me.\nGRAND RAPIDS\nJuly 17, 1962\nMr, Harold Hill,\nHat*1 Assoc, of Educational Broadcasters\nI3I46 Conn, Ave. HW\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Harold:\nEnclosed the only comments I have received so far about the Finster system.\nIn talking with Frymire and Underwood last week about this problem, we\nagreed that actually only a small number of stations were involved, too\nsmall to make them wag the dog, so to speak. However, if you wish to pursue\nthis further, Harrison’s suggestion for a poll of in-school stations should\ncertainly be considered. (Incidentally, I think we made real progress on the\nrules and regulations manual. It’s got some revolutionary concepts buried\nin it, oh so cleverly. The Board or other reviewers are going to have a\nfield day once we’re finished.)....No ideas yet on the grant-in-aid program.\nI’m too concerned about my future employment at the moment to think of\nmuch else. If something reasonably interesting doesn’t come along soon, I\nmay be out of this racket completely by this time next year.\nCordially,\nE.G-. Burrows"
