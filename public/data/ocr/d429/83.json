The other two categories\nare \"no\" and \"maybe\". But this is subject to a revision of the \"pro¬\ncedure\" section, which worried me, too.\nI<11 have to leave to you the step-by-step statement of groupings, tests\nto be used, Jdnes to be tested, etc* Perhaps you can now get together\nwith CBC or someone. It shouldnU run over on© or two pages, I*d think*\nIf this can be done, we*11 be ready to send in (very soon) as soon as\nwe receive the official word. This, of course, is subject to committee\napproval yet too, with those conditions. But I thought you might want\nto get right at it*\nNo philosophy, problems or narrative-—just step by step outline, of\nwhat, as now thought through# would be done, with whom, as precisely\nas possible.\nBest regards.\nHJStem\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director"
