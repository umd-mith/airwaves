  "text": "2\non the scope of the enquiry, as indicated in my introductory points.\nIf I were to suomit the proposal from my own point of view (which\nmay not be your own or that of Mr. McLuhan), I would say the following:\nProject Title: The nature of audip-visual media. To develop through\nthe&oretical analyisis and practical experimentation a clear notion\nof the peculiar style, structure and impact of the principal audio-visual\nmedia (Radio, Film, Television, Photography) which are changing\na civilization based primarily on the printed word, profoundly in¬\nfluencing the mind of young people, and offernSew challenges to\neducational methodology. The objective of obtaining a fresh under¬\nstanding of these media is to contribute to their better utilization in\nthe educational process and to the critical training of student audiences\nso they may experience them profitably while avoiding their many pitfalls.\nThis is merely my first draft of such a definition, and I regret\nenormously that we do not have the opportunity to talk this over in\ngreater detail so we may further sharpen the focus and limit its scope.\nI am a..are that I have broadened the scope to a point where it might\nbe impossible to accomplish it within the time and personel limitations.\nBut on the other hand I am convinced that the limitations imposed in '\nyour proposal will not stand up in practice and are liable to curtail\nvitally the considerable practical value which such a project might havei\nIt was a great pleasure meeting you again and being able to think\naloud and in common about a vital field which is close to your heart as\nwell as to mine.\nWith best regards."
