It is\nhoped that less than meaningful and dupiicatory inquiries can be\navoided or curtailed.\nThis office will be cooperative in administering the NER\nBoard policy, and we look forward to approving legitimate Inquiry\nmade of non-commercial radio stations.\nSincerely,\nRAMikh\ncc: Estell\nRobert A. Mott"
