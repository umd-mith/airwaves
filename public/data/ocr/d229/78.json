C.\nDear Mr. Swezeyj\nSamuel Holt has provided me with a copy of the Campus Radio\nStudy completed recently by Vince Badger for the Corporation for\nPublic Broadcasting and the Ford Foundation.\nI found the document informative and am writing to suggest\nthat CPB and/or Ford make a distribution of the study to all\nnoncommercial radio stations.\nWhile the document lacks the significance of the Holt Public\nRadio Study, I believe the Campus Radio report would be of value\nbo station managers of carrier current operations, ten watt FM stations\nand other noncommercial radio licensees.\nDissemination of the study to those who might utilize It most\nappropriately seems to be an important final step that the Corporation\nmight wish to take.\nSincerely,\nAvenue, N. W.\n20036\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM:kh"
