Plans are to publish a weekly\nbulletin which will describe present and proposed\nprojects in this field. Ken informs me that he plans\nto mail the first of these bulletins early next week.\nI am requesting him to put you on this mailing list so\nthat you will be kept up-to-date on all activities. I\nam also forwarding a copy of this letter to Ken, and\nif he has any further suggestions, I am sure you will\nhear from him*\nArt Hungerford asked me to include with this letter\nthe following information and attached enclosures;\n”1 find no place where it is proposed to set up a non¬\ncommercial inner-city radio station* Maybe Ken has\nsome information. I assume you’ve read NYT on Col¬\numbia Workshop, but here’s a carbon copy anyway.\nTalked to Erik Barnouw* He knew of Dr* Sol Worth\nat Annenberg School, University of Pennsylvania,\nPhiladelphia, who has been showing disadvantaged kids\nhow to make films. There is also a similar film unit\nfunctioning in NYC under Deputy Mayor Costello and\nuses facilities of WNYCj Sy Siegal, 2500 Municipal\nBldg., HYC, 10007, would know.\nAlso enclosed is flyer on Roger Penn’s trail-biasing\neffort here. He’s the finest; sincere and dedicated\nto a good cause. Certainly you want to see his work¬\nshop in August. I’m sure, also that John Taylor in\nChicago would be a gold mine of information.\nDoes any of this help?\"\nI will continue to mail you pertinent information\nthat may be helpful to you as I become aware of it.\nGood luck!\nSincerely,\nccs Mr. Ken Clark\nMr. Art Hungerford\nLucinda K.
