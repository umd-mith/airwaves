C. 20036\nDear Ken;\nCongratulations on your appointment! I hope we can develop a good_\nlibrary of exchangeable programs.\nI do not currently have any ghetto-prog ram s^ in our library that would\nbe usable beyond the San Diego community. We have done a few pro¬\ngrams relating to and involving members of that community, but they\nwere all timely and local. We are developing several programs that\nwill get us deeply involved in ghetto programing and that should relate\nto both the black and Mexican^American populations. While it is too\nsoon to say whether or not they would be useful beyond San Diego, I\nshould state that our emphasis at the moment will be on local programs\nrelated to local happenings. What would actually develop? remains to\nbe seen.\nWe will, as you suggest, take the initiative and inform you of anything\nydiich might be useful beyond our own environs._\nBradford B. Warner\nProgram Director\nKEBS-TV\nSAN DIEGO STATE COLLEGE. SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, 92115 * 714/286-6415"
