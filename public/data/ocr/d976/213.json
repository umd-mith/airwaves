He is given promises that are not kept,\nprojects that are temporary make-work with no true relationship to\nhis and his family's future, organizations that result only in talk,\npeople who come from a world of jobs and home and travel mobility\nthat is totally unrelated and barely understanding of the reality of\nthe black ghetto. Here is the same Kafkaesque world.\nI know you have heard much and read much about the inner-city\nand communications in recent weeks. And perhaps you feel inclined\nto turn me off. However, having been making speeches on this for the\n\\\npast three years, and observing that we don't do anything about it\nuntil one or more cities began to burn, I am inclined to keep on\ntalking--in the belief that it is better to try to solve these problems\nwith communication rather than with matches.\nThe March, 1968 Report of the National Advisory Commission on\nCivil Disorders goes further than any other national official state¬\nment on the problem. It concentrated on the providing of programs of\nspecial interest to the ghetto, and on representing more objectively\nthe needs and actions of the ghetto to the population as a whole. It\nalso suggested increased racial integration in the field of broadcasting\nIts recommendations relate to a part of the total problem\nand potential: toward improving the reportorial aspects of the media,\ntoward telling about, the inner-city. I believe we should go beyond"
