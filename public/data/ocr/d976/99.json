The \"state of the art\",\nand whether we should relate to \"systems\", is,\nwe believe, inextricably bound up with the\nspiralling needs of institutions, and people,\nwherever those needs occur. Experience has shown\nthat \"response to needs\" is the most critical factor\nin the fabric of growth, regardless of where\nthat^rowth has occurred.\nFrom time to time there have been outraged cries\nfrom certain sectors of our society when we re¬\ncommended the expenditure of \"almost\" as much\nmoney, for the education and rehabilitation of the\npoor and disadvantaged youth, as an average American\nmiddle-class family spends for the education of\ntheir children. Yet, we know that the law says\nthat no child shall be deprived of the right to\nan adequate education, or a person of the right\nto work, if he is capable. In spite of that, we\nknow that the central issue for the poor, and\nmore intensely for the minority poor, remains sbcial\nreinforcement of deprivation by exclusion. And\nthis intolerable condition does exist, in our\ncountry, in the latter half of the Twentieth Century."
