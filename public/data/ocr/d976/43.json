  "text": "Memorandum #9\nTO: Communications Coordinators, President's Council on\nYouth Opportunity\n1. Kirk Douglas Film\nI am enclosing two 16 mm. prints of a ten minute film\non the need for summer-time opportunity for youth. Kirk\nDouglas, filmed in Harlem, and Gregory Peck, in Watts,\npresent most effectively the need for more opportunity for\ninner-city youth. Kirk Douglas also directed the film,\nwhich was produced as a public service by Paramount Pictures.\nIt originally was produced for theater use, and 35 mm.\nprints now are being made available to theaters around the\ncountry. But I thought it also could be of use to you for\ntelevision programming, either as an admittedly-lengthy public\nservice spot, or as part of a discussion program or documentary\non Youth Opportunity. It also could be useful in discussion\ngroups, at civic club meetings, and other occasions where the\nsubject is appropriate.\nIn re television use: Vice President Humphrey closes the\nfilm. Obviously, his participation is an appeal for help in\nthe Youth Opportunity program. However, since it is an election\nyear and Mr. Humphrey is a candidate, TV stations may have\nlogical questions about using it. The head of our audio¬\nvisual department checked a print, and said it would be possible\nto take off the close and splice it back after use without\nloss of quality until after several such editings and resplicings."
