There is generally\na more flexible programming structure to deal with.\nThere is usually more time available in radio than\nthere is with television. These are critical factors.\nHowever, there are certain other problems with radio\nthat we do not face with television. In radio we are\ndealing with a one dimensional (audio) medium. This\nmeans that for certain kinds of program formats it\nwill be a more difficult problem to capture and hold"
