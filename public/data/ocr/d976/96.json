ER (Educational Radio)-\na mass communications capability with similar\ncharacteristics. As well as ideas for the\nestablishment of \"workable\" communications systems\nwhich can help bring the isolated poor closer to\nthe mainstream of American life.\nFurther, various sections of this paper will provide\nadequate guidelines for Community Action Agencies\nto become involved in the mass communications media.\nWe will indicate here the full range of responsibil¬\nity inherent in any relationship with the mass\ncommunications media, not alone describe the \"kinds\nof systems\" that are applicable. (The responsibility\nfor creating meaningful \"software\", which are the\nunder-pinning of educational broadcasting.) And\nlastly, we will be describing those orientational\nstructures for Community Action Agency staff, with¬\nout which much of any effort to relate to mass\ncommunications would be wasteful."
