One, the task of creating dynamic\nlistening materials, and two, the problem of\nachieving and maintaining attention for the whole\nperiod of exposure, in a setting conducive to learning.\nWe feel that in developing acceptable program formats\nfor radio broadcasting, the one variable, reflected\nbest in a description of age levels, is the concen¬\ntration span of the target population. Programs,\ntherefore, must be specifically designed for each age\ngrouping: the pre-school - the pre-teen - the teen¬\nager - and the adult population.\nWe believe that this is a more serious factor in re¬\ngard to radio broadcasting because of the total absence\nof the visual dimension, and because of the total\ndirect appeal to the imagination of the listening group.\nIn transmitting educational materials, certainly, the\nprobability of the environment intruding into the\nlearning situation is very high. In other situations,\nwith television, this becomes negligible as a factor."
