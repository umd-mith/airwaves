To make our publications wmustn reading to the people who\nneed such guidance as we can provide, and to achieve the distinction in format\nand editing which the content available is already beginning to achieve, the\ndrastic improvement wliich our request envisions appears essential. It also\nappears to offer the likelihood of more rapid fiscal returns than any of the other\nprojects proposed."
