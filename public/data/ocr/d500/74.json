REPUBLIC 7-8688\nAugust 18, 1953\nMr. Graydon Ausmus\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nUrbana, Illinois\nAtt: Mr. Frank Schooley\nDear Mr. Ausmus:\n\"Ways of Mankind\" is one of the most popular series in our\nsummer \"University of the Air.\" We have used only eight of the\nprograms as our session runs only eight weeks, but we shall use\nthe rest later. Now I am writing to put in my request for the\nsecond series. Last week the University Council voted to have\ntwo school terms this winter, at least one fall and one spring,\nand I hope to continue \"Ways of Mankind\" in our offerings.\nSeveral weeks ago we were asked to release the University\nof the Air lectures for the use of the blind. We would make a\nprice for the whole series which would cover recording and distribu¬\ntion. Is there any way that you would be willing to have us handle\n\"Ways of Mankind\" in the set? Of course we would get the albums\nfrom you unless the request was for tape. As there are only fifty\nsome colleges for the blind, we do not anticipate enough orders\nto justify pressings of the other lectures. I would appreciate\nyour answer on this as soon as possible.\nCongratulations on the new series on Mankind, and many thanks\nfor your cooperation in our efforts.\nJP:lk"
