I*m\nassuming you*re thinking here in terms of subject-matter areas for pro¬\ngrams and series — right? If not, I think the questionnaire should in¬\nclude a question indicating preferred or needed areas of knowledge. May¬\nbe something like this:\n\"List, in the order of your priority, the subject-matter areas in\nwhich you feel network program service can best fulfill your needs —\nsubject areas not now regularly offered. Also please indicate preferred\nformat for each.\nSUBJECT AREA PREFERRED FORMAT - TALK, DISCUSSION OR DRAMATIZATIC\n1.\n2.\n3.\nk*\n' 5.\n6.\n7.ETC.\"\nPossibly, it might even be advisable to include a specific check-list\nof subject areas -- i.e., LITERATURE, HISTORY, POLITICAL SCIENCE, SOCIAL\nSCIENCE, HEALTH, USEFUL KNOWLEDGE, (Home Decoration, Law For the Layman,\nBuilding a Home, etc.) and OTHERS--with a column, as above, indicating\npreferred format.\nThe above is merely an off-the-cuff suggestion for phrasing the ques¬\ntion.\nSection II, Ite?K2 *\nI think this itkm shoiiLd include the following question: \"If it\nwere possible for theNpetyork to make audition tapes available for sampl¬\ning sufficiently in adWe, would you prefer to audition a package be-\nfore \"befinitely s'cheduli nkthe included series (s) in your program bulle¬\ntin?\" (If this possibi 1 ifeySJ.s not feasible from a practical operations\nstandpoint, forget I eve» mentioned it I) . r"
