  "text": "November 2, 1953\nMEMOs\nTO: All Network Stations\nFROM: Network Headquarters\nRE: Orders for, and cost of, special recordings\nIn the past, the Network has accepted a great number\nof orders for tape recordings of past programs. The\ncharge has been $1.00 a reel. This has unfortunately\nonly covered NAEB8s recording cost, and has allowed\nnothing for packing, shipping and postage charges.\nBecause of efforts to reorganize Network procedures,\nin keeping with suggestions made at the recent annual\nconference, it will be impossible to accept any special\norders, except emergencies, until January 1, 1954.\nEffective as of that date, the charge for special re¬\ncordings will be $2.00 a reel. We regret this increase\nin fee, but it is necessitated by a careful study of the\ncost of honoring these orders.\nHeadquarters will also appreciate your keeping these\nspecial orders to minimum, to enable concentration on\nthe mass duplication and distribution aspects of our\noperation."
