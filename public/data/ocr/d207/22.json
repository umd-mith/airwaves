SYDNEY\n14th September 1967\n1/\nThank you very much for sending to me a copy of yomr letter of\n6 September to Mr Maeda. I am indeed very happy to know\nthat NAEB has decided to apply for associate membership of\nthe ABU and feel confident, as I told you in Paris last March,\nthat this application will be warmly welcomed by our existing\nmembers,\nI have heard today from the ABU Secretariat staff in Tokyo that\nyour application has been received there and I understand it\nis now being referred to our full members for a postal vote as\na matter of urgency. Although our full members are scattered\nover a wide area and it therefore takes a little time to collect\ntheir votes, it would still be possible for a decision to be\nmade in time for NAEB to be represented at our General Assembly\nin Singapore from 23 to 30 October if you are likely to be able\nto make the journey, which I hope will be the case.\nIf so, I would be grateful if you could let me know by cable\nso that tentative hotel reservations could be made in Singapore,\nThe situation regarding hotels is difficult because October is\nthe tourist season in Singapore and making extra reservations\nat the last moment is therefore likely to involve real problems,\nI will lobk forward to hearing from you on this point.\nWith kind regards,\nYours sincerely,\nMr William G. Harley,\nPresident,\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters,\n1346 Connec+T n»t Avenue. *•\nWASHINGTON.\nU,S,A,\noh ms"
