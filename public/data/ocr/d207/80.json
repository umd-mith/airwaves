  "text": "WGH:\nRE Asian Broadcastinq Union\nThere are several prohlems, it seems to me• Article J of the Statutes,\ndealing with membership, stipulate that to be a member an organization\nmust produce and have general r esponsibility for the programs broadcast\nby one or more transmitters \"permanently at its disposal.\" (See Secs• 1 and\n2 of Art• J, p 2) This would seem to eliminate us, if they stick to this\nrule.\nSo far as the dues are concerned, we would apparently have to pay $1500\nannually under the current value of the \"unit\" which is $100. Item 5 (h)\nof the membership application form stipulates that the operational budgets\nof associations, for purpose of assessing dues, shall be the combined\noperational budgets of i ts members. This would put buck us in the nTn\nexcess of~~$100,000,000 category• Even if a more modest figure were used\nfor tjrg combined budgets of all our members, it would certainlv be in excess\nof $90,000,000 uhich would put us in the 15 unit ca,zeg*or'y')~wiifch\nmaximum number of units for which Associate members in ABU must pay. (See\nArt• 14, Secs• 2 and J of Statutes, p• 8) This maximum of 15 units is also\nalluded to in the sixth paragraph on pgge J of Moses' letter to you* He\nstates that they don't intend to raise the xmmbxrnxmfm amount of the unit\nabove $100, but there is nothing legallv to precl ude their doing so,\nin uhich case our dues would go above $1500 annually.\nheh\n9/14/65"
