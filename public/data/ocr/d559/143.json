Hill\nAdministrative Vice President, NAEB j\n13L6 Connecticut Avenue N.W. *\nWashington, D.C.\nDear Harold:\nUnder separate cover I am sending you 200 copies of the report of the\nPublic Relations Committee for distribution at our meeting. I will\nhave a few extra copies with me in Washington in case the number sent\nyou proves inadequate.\nChanging the subject a little, I have an idea that would insure more\nadequately than is usually the case the continuity of the Public\nRelations Committee. If you could prevail upon Bill Harley to choose\nthe chairman of this committee previous to our meeting, I will have\nan opportunity to go over everything in detail so that he or she will\nknow the exact status. In fact I am going to bring my entire file with\nme in anticipation of such an action. Again I would like to say that\nin my opinion, Marion Corwell is head and shoulders above anyone else\non our present committee for the chairmanship.\nElmer G. Sulzer, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\nEGS:mp\ncc: Betty McKenzie"
