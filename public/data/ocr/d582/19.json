  "text": "What does Radio Free Europe say? Through exile\nvoices RFE uses information, exposure and ridicule\nto undermine the enemy’s morale and authority. It\nidentifies police informers and denounces brutality. It\nspikes Red propaganda and spreads news the Soviets\nwould rather have suppressed.\nRFE does more. Through cultural, religious and\neducational programs it helps meet the spiritual and\nintellectual needs of its listeners. Through broadcasts\nto youth it stimulates their moral resistance to the\npoisons of Communism.\nThe Communists, revealing their fear and vulner¬\nability to the truth, react violently to RFE with noisy\njamming and angry refutations. They will be hit still\nharder as RFE’s “Freedom Network” is extended.\n2. INTELLECTUAL COOPERATION\nThe exiles possess important intellectual resources.\nWhile the Communists press to destroy the native cul¬\ntures of the captive countries, the Division of Intel¬\nlectual Cooperation nourishes these cultural values in\nthe free world."
