Unfortunately, it will not be possible for\nme to attend and I will leave it to you to cancel the room\nreservation which you have made for me.\nInasmuch as the supplement to the contract is far from being\ncomplete, there will be some delay in getting final approval.\nI believe that Jim Fellows has already written you about the\nmatter including the possibility of a postponement of the\nmeeting. I share his opinion but it will be up to him and\nClair to make the final decision. If it is postponed, I sin¬\ncerely hope it cen be scheduled for s time when I can be free\nto be with you.\nBest wishes always.\nSincerely yours.\ncc: Mr. Clair Tettemer\nMr. James Fellows ,\n(Mrs.) Gertrude G. Broderick\nEducational Media Specialist"
