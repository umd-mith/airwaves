  "text": "7 December 1961\nDear Sam,\nSorry for the delay in responding to your letter of\nNovember l£, but T had to be out In Berkeley and Palo Alto\nand simply was unable to effectively keep up with any of\nmy recent correspondence*\nIn principle, I believe that in Bill flarley's notion of\nan rAEB-sa netioned Audience Survey Research organization\nthere appear to be several problems that such an organi¬\nzation would face* First of all, as T pointed out in my\npaper that appeared in the MAEB Journal on the Rating\nServices, even a group of educators involved in audience\nresearch might very well encounter the same problems in\n1) the uncontrollable problem in operational aspects in\nconducting television surveys and 2) the possible biased\nuses of such results by stations, advertising agencies,\nor whoever is footing the bill. However, I would be\nhappy to explore further the possibilities of Bill Harley's\nnotion, since any attempt toward \"clearing the air\" in the\ntelevision research audience area should be carefully con¬\nsidered*\n?3y the way, our current Title VII Project is revealing some\nfascinating data* Our factor analysis particularly gave us\nsome unusual insights* As I promised, T will send you a\ncopy of the final report as soon as it is completed.\nKeep in touch (hope we can get together one of these days\nS OOXl) t\nCordially yours,\nRichard I* Evans\nProfessor of Psychology\nSamuel L* ecker. Chairman\nNAEB Research Committee\n111 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nRIEsv\ncci Mr* 'ill Harley"
