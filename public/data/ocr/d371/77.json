Supposedly, the results would be\nthe property of a station; there would be minimum opportunity for publi¬\ncation.\nNow I am willing to be convinced that there is a place for an outside\norganization to come in and make an open study of a station’s programs and\na community’s needs, and make the results publically known, but I am not\nyet convinced that this is the pattern of it.”\nKumata: \"Let me respond briefly to Harley’s proposal for the establish¬\nment oF audience survey service. My first reaction is negative. I think\nthe idea is a good one but does not require the setting up a national office\nor the hiring of a full time national research director. Instead, let me\nsuggest a consulting service with a roster of persons on call who could go\nto the localities concerned to help stations.\nMy objection to a full blown research operation takes the following:\na. The returns from such surveys (assuming that wealthy stations and\nstations near Universities need no help) will not support a full time oper¬\nation.\nb. The research opportunities which arise from such activity will he\nnegligible since I fear that the setting up of the survey will be on a\nhurry-up basis and will not entail the kind of planning necessary to make\nthe survey much more than a sheer nose-counting procedure.\nCo College and university staff members are not going to fall over\nthemselves to try and get one of these survey jobs. From experience, both\nof us know that simply because the cause is good does not mean any kind of\nresearch assistance particularly when the nature of the project is preset.\ndo There are not enough persons interested in research who are also\ninterested in broadcasting to make any kind of viable organization a\nrealistic accomplishment.\ne, No estimate of cost of surveys is included in the proposal. My\nfeeling is that most stations are not willing to dish out the money to get\nany decent survey done. If a simple nose-counting procedure is all they\nneed, why not underwrite a simple manual of how-to-do-it and sell this to\nstations?”\nYou have my comments, which I sent to you when you first made the pro¬\nposal. They are similar to those of Schramm and Kumata.\nI am sorry that we were unable to meet, as a committee, in Washington\nin order to thrash out some of these points and to give you a concrete re¬\ncommendation. However, as I indicated above, there are some ideas which\nthese men have contributed in their reactions which I believe you and the\nnext research committee should find helpful.\nCordially,\nBecker\ncc: NAEB Research\nCommittee members"
