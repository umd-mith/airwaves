W\nWashington 69 D. C.\nDear Harold:\nI have discussed the problems of being away from campus for three or\nfour contiguous days during the summer session with my boss here and\nam afraid that Z will not be able to make it. I am scheduled to teach\nclasses five days a week and have already accepted commitments to\nlecture on other campuses twice during the eight-week summer session.\nThe feeling here is that this would simply be too much, coming on top\nof theee other absences. X feel badly about this because it sounds\nas though it will be an excellent meeting. Though X was not present\nat it, the Allerton House seminar report still seems to be one of the\noutstanding documents ever drafted by an educational broadcasting group.\nXf you want a representative of the research committee present, and\nX believe that one should be there, X would suggest Bruce Westley, who\nwill be on the campus presumably since he is teaching at Wisconsin.\nX appreciate the invitation. X look forward to hearing the results of\nthe seminar.\nSincerely,\nSLB;ks\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film"
