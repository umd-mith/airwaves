C.\nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nAugust 25, 19 61\nMr. Sam Becker\nDir. Div. of TV-Film-Radio\nTelevision Center\nState University of Iowa\n609 10th Ave.\nIowa City,IOWA\nDear Sam:\nLet me try out an ide^e^yogjnd get your reactions as to its feasibility,\npropriety, and apprSpriatnessT\"'*\"*\" *.\nAs you know, the commercial industry has been under attack from both- the\npublic and its representative in Congress and the FCC. The latter body,\nunder Mr. Minow’s leadership,has repeatedly indicated that it has a respon¬\nsibility and authority to concern itself with stations’ programs. As earnest\nof its intention to do something about programming,it has indicated that it\nwill be paying increasing attention to discrepancies between program pro¬\nmises and performance when it comes to license renewals .\nThe result of this crackdown on station programming is that the station\nmanager at long last is convinced that the FCC means what it -gays and is\ngoing to get tough; hence stations are belatedly becoming very worried about\nhow to beef up the educational content of their schedules. To capitalize\non their concern,NAEB has just issued a flyer calling to their attention the\nsplendid selection of high quality educational programs available from its\ntape library.\nThe FCC has also indicated that in considering renewals of licenses it will\npay attention to how well a station has geared its programming to meet the\nneeds and interests of the community it serves. They have also indicated\nthat in satisfying this requirement a station is not going to be able to just\n“fly by the seat of its pants”, be guided by questions the director asks at\nthe bar of the local Elks club, or use any other quaint divining rods which\nhave gotten them by in the past. In fact, this means audience surveys."
