In case the Foundation wished to call a meet¬\ning of educators to consider it, or to refer it to others who may be less\nfamiliar with the NAEB than you are, it was our belief that this more\ncomprehensive statement might be useful. 1/Ve shall be glad to provide\nadditional copies if they are desired.\nWe are most grateful to the W.

We would be glad to provide\nany other information required for its consideration at any time.\nSincerely,\nhjs;rs Executive Director\nEnclosures (3)\nCC: NAEB Board of Directors"
