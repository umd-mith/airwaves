Planning long-range programs of research\n3. Laying out specific research designs\n4. Drawing up research proposals for obtaining financial aid\nwhen necessary\n5. Evaluating research results.\nI believe that the Ford Foundation might be interested in such a group,\nif the consultants were of sufficient ability, because of many of their\nexperiences with giving grants to institutions which did not know fehat to\ndo with the research funds after they got them. I would think that they\nmight be approached on such a project* I believe that the Title VII\npersonnel might also be approached, namely Roy Hall and Walter Stone* One\nof their problems is that many of the potentially good research proposals\nare coming from persons completely lacking in research sophistication*\nWith proper guidance, some of these persons could make an important con¬\ntribution. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare is not in a\nposition to provide this guidance* An outside agency, sustained in part\nby Department funds, I would think could provide tnis help*"
