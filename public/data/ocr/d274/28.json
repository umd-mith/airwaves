  "text": "THE BACKGROUND OF THE DREAM\nIn the early 20*3, as radio program broadcasting began to become a factor on\nthe American scene, many educational agencies and institutions entered the\nfield and established broadcasting stations of their own* The process is\nfairly well described in Whitens \"American Radio\" part of the University of\nChicago Freedom of the Press Report under a chapter headed \"The Light that\nFailed\"o This report pointed out that nearly 200 institutions had at one\ntime achieved broadcast licenses but that by the early 1930*s the number had\ndiminished to under 1*0 institutionso Licensees initially had included boards\nof education, colleges, universities, etc®\nActually several factors leading to this disappointing attrition were at work*\n1® Many of the licensees were in fact not broadcasting enterprises at\nall, but rather the licensed experimental activity of a physics de¬\npartment or an electrical engineering laboratory®\n2* When the actual day-by-day program realities began to impinge on\nthese stations—for both philosophical and fiscal reasons—they\nceased to be®\n3. Many educators failed to see the tremendous potential in radio broad¬\ncasting and measured the future opportunities against the-then-\nexistent performance standards of commercial stations whose program\nfare was by and large cheap and distasteful to them®\nNone of the \"great\" universities such as Yale, Harvard, Columbia, the Uni¬\nversity of Chicago, etc® ever operated stations of their own. Significantly\nmost of the survivors of the 30 *s were Land-Grant College institutions where\nthe chartered obligation of the school was to serve \"all of the citizens of\nthe state, not those on the campus alone”. Hence, the concept of wide-audience\nservice as opposed to the \"cloistered hall” concept of the normal liberal arts\ninstitutions made such a medium as radio more understandable as a device for\na Land-Grant college to use®\nThe hopes were high in the early days and as one individual put it, \"educators\nset up stations expecting the thirsty thousands to come and drink from the\nfountain of learningj however, while the waters flowed the citizens were drink¬\ning from other sources, wooed by the strains of music preceding plugs for\ntoothpaste and other items of commerce”®\nThe NAEB and other organizations in an early day developed an elaborate plan\nof national organization for educational broadcasting with a pattern of\nfoundation financing which has elements of similarity to the present education¬\nal television development® Unhappily, much of the money in the 20*s and 30's\nwent into an unrewarding kind of research. A great deal of time and monqy\nwere spent on \"evaluating educational programs\" when obviously the crying need\nwas to create and produce educational programs of some merit and quantity,\naccording to the best current judgments available—and then to really display\nthem. It was as if the Metropolitan Opera in its initial New York performance\nhad put up a tent, pared the budget for \"II Trovatore”, eliminated half the\ncast and all the sets, used a five-piece \"combo** instead of the full orchestra,\nand then spent thousands and thousands of dollars to evaluate the effect upon"
