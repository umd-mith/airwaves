Stone\nManager, KCTS-TV\nUniversity of Washington\nSeattle 5, Washington\nDear Loren:\nWould you be good enough to sit down and dictate your concept of\nour relationship with NETRC and, for that matter, with all other\norganizations and groups working with the general field of educational\nbroadcasting.\nMuch of what you said may ultimately appear In the mtnutes, but\nI don’t have It In hand, and your skillful phrasing and statement of\nposition would be useful to me in passing on the sense of the meeting\nto Jack White and explaining why the letter of agreement was tabled.\nAside from that one unfortunate incident, it was a good meeting and\nI think we’ve come a long way in arriving at a better understanding\nof our role and the directions we should take.\nCordially yours.\nWGH:rkf\nWilliam G. Harley\nPresident"
