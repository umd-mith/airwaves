Stone\nManager, KCTS-TV\nUniversity of Washington\nSeattle 5, Washington\nDear Loren:\nThe matter you referred to in your letter concerning the American\nCouncil on Education was really a vote to accept a contract from Title VII\nto organize a study of copyrights and compensation for educational\nbroadcasting.\nDr. Stone has told me that this will be divided into sections and\nportions of it subcontracted or at least a great many of the interested\ngroups will be brought into the study and given ample opportunity to\npresent their views; in fact, they will be requested to provide their ex¬\npert insights into the problem. He assured me that NAEB would be in¬\nvolved in any such consideration. Thus, actually, I think this is proba¬\nbly a pretty good way to handle it. As you know, NAEB has been talk¬\ning about the need for doing this kind of thing for a long time but it was\nreally too big a problem for us to undertake. As a matter of fact, there\nis really no one organization capable of doing it although the American\nCouncil probably comes as close to it as any. Evem so, many organizag\ntions and groups need to be brought into this study for it has widespread\nramifications throughout the entire educational community.\nThe main thing is to rejoice that ad&Lon is finally going to be\ntaken on this matter that we have all talked about for so long as a\npressing need. I assure you that when time is ripe for the Television\nBoard you will be so informed.\nCongratulations on the handsome booklet about Channel 9. That's\none of the most attractive promotion pieces I have seen come out of any\nETV shop.\nCordially yours.\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGHradt"
