Hull, Executive Director\nMS s °\nt.\nAugust 28, 1961\nWUHam Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N. W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Bill:\nWOSU TELEVISION\n2470 North Star Road\nColumbus 21, Ohio\nAs Harold Hill will have indicated, 1 called today to report that\nthe letter you and I discussed for some reason has not arrived and\nalso to note the possible switch in signals on the Robert*s bill\nwhich Lennie Harks indicated might now be proper strategy. I added\na reaction I had to the NAEB press release for the JCEB session\nAugust 30 which he will report. A fine statement, I thought. My\n\"editorial comment\" was only in response to what I thought might\nbe policy overtones.\nGood to see you. Thanks for the ride to the airport. Good old\nUnited was ten minutes late departing so I had even more margin\nthan I thought.\nSincerely,\nP.S. Since this letter was dictated, your letter dated August 23rd\nwas received. Have also mentioned this in a letter to Harold\nthat some of your staff use the address of the radio station,\n215 W. 19th Ave. This delays our mail for one day—if it is\nsent to 2470 N. Star Road, Columbus 21, one of the middlemen isy\neliminated and we get prompt service.\nTeaching Aids Laboratory • Office o) Seminars and Workshops • Ohio School of the Air • Video Recording • WOSU—WOSU-FM—WOSU-TV • Closed Circuit TV"
