I have made reservations to fly to\nWashington on the First, can appear on the Second, and\nwill return here on the third. 1*11 make hotel reser¬\nvations when I am there next week.\nYou*11 probably get this letter as fast as a wire, so\nthought I would write, instead.\nOn my trip next week I'm coming in on Tuesday, will be\nat the Dupont Plaia Tuesday night. Id like to spend\nsome time with you Wed. — also go over to the hill to\nsee Magnuson and Carl Downing. I'll call you during\nthe early part of Wed. morning. If you'd like to go\nwith me to see both Carl and Magnuson, I'd be happy to\nhave you do so. If you are tied up, leave word at the\nhotel when you'll be free and I'll wander over to the\nhill and catch you later.\nLoren\nUniversity of Washington Seattle Public Schools <s King County Schools Seattle University Seattle Pacific College Seattle Public Library"
