  "text": "7\nThis type of proceeding is sufficiently flexible so that\nall the various alternatives could be explored, and the JCET\nwould have the opportunity to sake a general showing of need and\nachievement.\nHowever, it is our further recommendation that the\nproceeding should not be limited to a general investigation\nunder Rule 1.10* Rather, it should be coupled with a petition\nfor rule-making under Section 1,202 which describes the\nprocedure to be followed in requests for changes in rules. Our\npetition for rule-making should request amendment of the rules\nembodying the TV channel allocations, so as to put an asterisk\n(signifying an educational reservation) on relocated Channel 12\nwhich can be made available for ETV in either Detroit or Cleveland,\nand another asterisk on Channel 13 which will become available\nin Rochester The petition should also request that the FCC\nadopt a new rule, under which any new VHF channel assignment\nwould be reserved for educational use, unless coverage is already\nbeing provided by an existing YHF educational station or there Is\na YHF reservation.\nIt is our belief that the Commission would entertain such\na proceeding and give serious consideration to the problems\ndiscussed in this memorandum. If the Commission does not take\nfavorable action, other and more drastic procedures are available*\nIt is possible, for example, to challenge the license renewal"
