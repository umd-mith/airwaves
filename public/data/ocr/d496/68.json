Schenkkan\nI am enclosing for your information a copy of a letter\nfrom Bob Schenkkan of May 23 which deals in part with a\nmembership drive. I realize that you were not at the\nColumbus luncheon to which this comment refers, so that you\ndo not know exactly what Willsea was referring to; but I\nthought you would like to see Schenkkan*s comment anyway."
