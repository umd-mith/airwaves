Even though he differs from the majority opinion\non one or two items, his vote alone does not change any of the\nfinal conclusions set forth. Therefore, I am not attempting\nto integrate his statements into the already-typed memorandum\nat this time. But when X hear from a few more Board members,\nI shall issue a final summary."
