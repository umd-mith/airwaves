I’ll record some inten¬\ntions. Meanwhile, hope you’ve recovered from the ’flu. I’ll be\nsending you comments or reports on the following:\n1. Reply to Executive Committee inquiry regarding probable\nstatus of the JOURNAL.\n2. Report of visit with Ed Stasheff.\n3. Report of JCET executive committee meeting.\n4. Report of visit with Dr. Faust.\n5. Report of session with NBC’s VP Joe Heffeman.\n6. Report on JOURNAL request response. Right here. Picked\nup article from Ed Stasheff he was planning to forward. Picked up\npromise of review from Stasheff. Received three or four from Tracy —\nhe, too. was just ready to mail me. Dan O’Connor (with Elmer in\nFlorida) wrote and sent along an article.\n?. We have now billed everyone on the old AERT list, subscribers\nand memberships, and we are getting back some monies, some cancel¬\nlations, ana some data that will help us improve listing. Some real\ndead ones on the list. Example: Ola sends back note that teacher\nlisted as AERT active member has been gone from Flint for two years.\nWhen we get this process done, we ought to be able to divide between\nsubscribers and memberships. That’s desirable.\n8. Hope to see Dick and Keith In Columbus on Monday.\n9* Will respond to Miles’ committee letters. I hold some\ndifferent opinions. In degrees, and shall express them and why. In\npart, this may overlap 1 above or be a total answer to the inquiries.\n10. Better come down with the Minnesota basketball team next\nSaturday."
