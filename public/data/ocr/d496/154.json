Special consideration also was\ngiven to educational broadcasting and the PCC; to public relations\nproblems; and to the ever-important question of long-term financial\nsupport for educational broadcasting.\nThe various Interests involved in educational broadcasting,\nand the organizations set up to serve them, were Identified.\nThose whose orientation is broadcasting were recognized as\nIncluding such groups as the NAEB, the ETRC, and the JCET.\nGroups less directly involved in broadcasting, although still\nvitally concerned with its results, were seen to be as varied as\nassociations of teachers and organisations of educational\nInstitutions.
