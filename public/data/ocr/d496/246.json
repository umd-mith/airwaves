I believe that the Bureau should be requested specifically\nto:\n1 • Identify radio and television households on a county-by-\ncounty basis •\n2 • Identify each radio household as to whether it can receive FM •\n3 • Identify each television household as to whether the set can\nreceive UHF and/or color.\nYou probably are already underway in this regard. A letter Armand received from Hal Fellows\nstresses the urgency of action .lam proposing that we make common cause with the NAB in this\nregard because it is my personal feeling that we would not get very far by requesting such services\nonly in those areas covered by educational broadcasting stations. Picking out such areas and\narranging the survey to include only them would be too much trouble for the Bureau of the Census.\nSincerely,,\n/s/ prying R. Merrill"
