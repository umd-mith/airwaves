Senator Magnus on of\nWashington introduced S* 2119.* A copy is attached to this memorandum*\nThis bill posos a major policy problem* All of us would\nlike very much to have an extra million dollars to start or to\nimprove television broadcasting* But this involves us in the\ncomplications of Federalistste relationships, and we need guidance\nfrom our respective administrative superiors before we can take\npositions*\nWhen this bill was discussed at the JCET meeting of May 22*\nIt was decided by the representatives of both the Association of\nState Universities and the Association of Chief State School Officers\nto refer this to their policy advisors* This is precisely what\nI am doing here at the University of Minnesota* If my president\nand vice«presldents have any comments of interest to the rest\nof you, I shall transmit them to you immediately* But I did not\nwant to hold this memorandum until I heard from them, for which\nreason I am sending this along now for your reactions*\nAt this point, therefore, I make no recommendation as tb the\naction we should take* I should point out* however, that In any\ncase, given the present temper of both houses of Congress on\nappropriations, such a bill seems unlikely of passage* This,\nhowever, is no reason why we should not take a position on it,\nand I request your reactions*"
